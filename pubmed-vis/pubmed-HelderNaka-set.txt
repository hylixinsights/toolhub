TI  - Defining CD8+ T cells that provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 therapy.
PG  - 417-421

AB  - Chronic viral infections are characterized by a state of CD8(+) T-cell 
      dysfunction that is associated with expression of the programmed cell death 1 
      (PD-1) inhibitory receptor. A better understanding of the mechanisms that 
      regulate CD8(+) T-cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve 
      immunotherapies that restore function in exhausted CD8(+) T cells. Here we 
      identify a population of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells that proliferate after 
      blockade of the PD-1 inhibitory pathway in mice chronically infected with 
      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells 
      expressed the PD-1 inhibitory receptor, but also expressed several costimulatory 
      molecules such as ICOS and CD28. This CD8(+) T-cell subset was characterized by a 
      unique gene signature that was related to that of CD4(+) T follicular helper 
      (T(FH)) cells, CD8(+) T cell memory precursors and haematopoietic stem cell 
      progenitors, but that was distinct from that of CD4(+) T(H)1 cells and CD8(+) 
      terminal effectors. This CD8(+) T-cell population was found only in lymphoid 
      tissues and resided predominantly in the T-cell zones along with naive CD8(+) T 
      cells. These PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells resembled stem cells during chronic LCMV 
      infection, undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally 
      exhausted CD8(+) T cells that were present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid 
      tissues. The proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost exclusively from 
      this CD8(+) T-cell subset. Notably, the transcription factor TCF1 had a 
      cell-intrinsic and essential role in the generation of this CD8(+) T-cell subset. 
      These findings provide a better understanding of T-cell exhaustion and have 
      implications in the optimization of PD-1-directed immunotherapy in chronic 
      infections and cancer.

AB  - The structure and function of the immune system is governed by complex networks 
      of interactions between cells and molecular components. Vaccination perturbs 
      these networks, triggering specific pathways to induce cellular and humoral 
      immunity. Systems vaccinology studies have generated vast data sets describing 
      the genes related to vaccination, motivating the use of new approaches to 
      identify patterns within the data. Here, we describe a framework called Network 
      Vaccinology to explore the structure and function of biological networks 
      responsible for vaccine-induced immunity. We demonstrate how the principles of 
      graph theory can be used to identify modules of genes, proteins, and metabolites 
      that are associated with innate and adaptive immune responses. Network 
      vaccinology can be used to assess specific and shared molecular mechanisms of 
      different types of vaccines, adjuvants, and routes of administration to direct 
      rational design of the next generation of vaccines.

AB  - COVID-19 can result in severe lung injury. It remained to be determined why 
      diabetic individuals with uncontrolled glucose levels are more prone to develop 
      the severe form of COVID-19. The molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and what determines the onset of the cytokine storm found in severe 
      COVID-19 patients are unknown. Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched 
      immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central 
      role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon 
      infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. 
      The infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production, which induces stabilization 
      of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and consequently promotes glycolysis. 
      HIF-1α-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by SARS-CoV-2 infection directly 
      inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival. Targeting HIF-1ɑ may 
      have great therapeutic potential for the development of novel drugs to treat 
      COVID-19.

TI  - Gasdermin D inhibition prevents multiple organ dysfunction during sepsis by 
      blocking NET formation.
PG  - 2702-2713
LID - 10.1182/blood.2021011525 [doi]
AB  - Multiple organ dysfunction is the most severe outcome of sepsis progression and 
      is highly correlated with a worse prognosis. Excessive neutrophil extracellular 
      traps (NETs) are critical players in the development of organ failure during 
      sepsis. Therefore, interventions targeting NET release would likely effectively 
      prevent NET-based organ injury associated with this disease. Herein, we 
      demonstrate that the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is active in 
      neutrophils from septic humans and mice and plays a crucial role in NET release. 
      Inhibition of GSDMD with disulfiram or genic deletion abrogated NET formation, 
      reducing multiple organ dysfunction and sepsis lethality. Mechanistically, we 
      demonstrate that during sepsis, activation of the caspase-11/GSDMD pathway 
      controls NET release by neutrophils during sepsis. In summary, our findings 
      uncover a novel therapeutic use for disulfiram and suggest that GSDMD is a 
      therapeutic target to improve sepsis treatment.

AB  - During persistent antigen stimulation, CD8(+) T cell responses are maintained by 
      progenitor exhausted CD8(+) T (Tpex) cells. Tpex cells respond to blockade of the 
      inhibitory receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and regulation of their 
      differentiation is critical for immunotherapies. Tpex cells highly express 
      inducible costimulator (ICOS), but how ICOS modulates PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells is 
      not clear. During chronic infection, intrinsic ICOS deficiency increased number 
      and quality of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. Loss of ICOS potentiated activity 
      of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and memory-like features of 
      Tpex cells. ICOS-deficient Tpex cells were poised to generate effecor-like cells 
      with improved survival and cytokine production. ICOS-ligand (ICOSL) blockade 
      expanded effector-like PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells, reduced viral load, and improved 
      response to PD-1 blockade. Similarly, in a mouse model of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, ICOS inhibition enhanced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and 
      tumor control by PD-1 blockade. Overall, we show that sustained ICOS 
      costimulation limits CD8(+) T cell responses during chronic antigen exposure.

      humans to an H5N1 influenza vaccine, with and without the AS03 adjuvant, to 
      identify factors influencing antibody response magnitude and durability. Our 
      findings revealed a platelet and adhesion-related blood transcriptional signature 
      on day 7 that predicted the longevity of the antibody response, suggesting a 
      potential role for platelets in modulating antibody response durability. As 
      platelets originate from megakaryocytes, we explored the effect of thrombopoietin 
      (TPO)-mediated megakaryocyte activation on antibody response longevity. We found 
      that TPO administration enhanced the durability of vaccine-induced antibody 
      responses. TPO-activated megakaryocytes also promoted survival of human 
      bone-marrow plasma cells through integrin β1/β2-mediated cell-cell interactions, 
      along with survival factors APRIL and the MIF-CD74 axis. Using machine learning, 
      we developed a classifier based on this platelet-associated signature, which 
      predicted antibody response longevity across six vaccines from seven independent 
      trials, highlighting a conserved mechanism for vaccine durability.

AB  - Sepsis results in elevated adenosine in circulation. Extracellular adenosine 
      triggers immunosuppressive signaling via the A2a receptor (A2aR). Sepsis 
      survivors develop persistent immunosuppression with increased risk of recurrent 
      infections. We utilized the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis and 
      subsequent infection to assess the role of adenosine in post-sepsis immune 
      suppression. A2aR-deficient mice showed improved resistance to post-sepsis 
      infections. Sepsis expanded a subset of CD39(hi) B cells and elevated 
      extracellular adenosine, which was absent in mice lacking CD39-expressing B 
      cells. Sepsis-surviving B cell-deficient mice were more resistant to secondary 
      infections. Mechanistically, metabolic reprogramming of septic B cells increased 
      production of ATP, which was converted into adenosine by CD39 on plasmablasts. 
      Adenosine signaling via A2aR impaired macrophage bactericidal activity and 
      enhanced interleukin-10 production. Septic individuals exhibited expanded 
      CD39(hi) plasmablasts and adenosine accumulation. Our study reveals CD39(hi) 
      plasmablasts and adenosine as important drivers of sepsis-induced 
      immunosuppression with relevance in human disease.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine, yet we remain 
      largely ignorant of the mechanisms by which successful vaccines stimulate 
      protective immunity. Two recent advances are beginning to illuminate such 
      mechanisms: realization of the pivotal role of the innate immune system in 
      sensing microbes and stimulating adaptive immunity, and advances in systems 
      biology. Recent studies have used systems biology approaches to obtain a global 
      picture of the immune responses to vaccination in humans. This has enabled the 
      identification of early innate signatures that predict the immunogenicity of 
      vaccines, and identification of potentially novel mechanisms of immune 
      regulation. Here, we review these advances and critically examine the potential 
      opportunities and challenges posed by systems biology in vaccine development.

TI  - C5aR1 signaling triggers lung immunopathology in COVID-19 through neutrophil 
      extracellular traps.
LID - 10.1172/JCI163105 [doi]
LID - e163105
AB  - Patients with severe COVID-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
      that may progress to cytokine storm syndrome, organ dysfunction, and death. 
      Considering that complement component 5a (C5a), through its cellular receptor 
      C5aR1, has potent proinflammatory actions and plays immunopathological roles in 
      inflammatory diseases, we investigated whether the C5a/C5aR1 pathway could be 
      involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology. C5a/C5aR1 signaling increased locally in 
      the lung, especially in neutrophils of critically ill patients with COVID-19 
      compared with patients with influenza infection, as well as in the lung tissue of 
      K18-hACE2 Tg mice (Tg mice) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Genetic and pharmacological 
      inhibition of C5aR1 signaling ameliorated lung immunopathology in Tg-infected 
      mice. Mechanistically, we found that C5aR1 signaling drives neutrophil 
      extracellular traps-dependent (NETs-dependent) immunopathology. These data 
      confirm the immunopathological role of C5a/C5aR1 signaling in COVID-19 and 
      indicate that antagonists of C5aR1 could be useful for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Characteristics and anatomic location of PD-1(+)TCF1(+) stem-like CD8 T cells in 
      chronic viral infection and cancer.
PG  - e2221985120
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2221985120 [doi]
LID - e2221985120
AB  - CD8 T cells play an essential role in antitumor immunity and chronic viral 
      infections. Recent findings have delineated the differentiation pathway of CD8 T 
      cells in accordance with the progenitor-progeny relationship of TCF1(+) stem-like 
      and Tim-3(+)TCF1(-) more differentiated T cells. Here, we investigated the 
      characteristics of stem-like and differentiated CD8 T cells isolated from several 
      murine tumor models and human lung cancer samples in terms of phenotypic and 
      transcriptional features as well as their location compared to virus-specific CD8 
      T cells in the chronically lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected 
      mice. We found that CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in both murine and 
      human tumors exhibited overall similar phenotypic and transcriptional 
      characteristics compared to corresponding subsets in the spleen of chronically 
      infected mice. Moreover, stem-like CD8 TILs exclusively responded and produced 
      effector-like progeny CD8 T cells in vivo after antigenic restimulation, 
      confirming their lineage relationship and the proliferative potential of 
      stem-like CD8 TILs. Most importantly, similar to the preferential localization of 
      PD-1(+) stem-like CD8 T cells in T cell zones of the spleen during chronic LCMV 
      infection, we found that the PD-1(+) stem-like CD8 TILs in lung cancer samples 
      are preferentially located not in the tumor parenchyma but in tertiary lymphoid 
      structures (TLSs). The stem-like CD8 T cells are present in TLSs located within 
      and at the periphery of the tumor, as well as in TLSs closely adjacent to the 
      tumor parenchyma. These findings suggest that TLSs provide a protective niche to 
      support the quiescence and maintenance of stem-like CD8 T cells in the tumor.

TI  - Modulation of neuroimmune cytokine networks by antidepressants: implications in 
      mood regulation.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is increasingly recognized as a neuroinflammatory 
      condition characterized by dysregulated cytokine networks. This comprehensive 
      review examines the immunomodulatory effects of antidepressant medications, 
      revealing their significant impact on Th1/Th2 cytokine balance beyond their 
      classical neurotransmitter actions. Clinical data show that diverse 
      antidepressant classes consistently demonstrate immunomodulatory properties that 
      extend beyond their classical neurotransmitter effects. These medications reduce 
      pro-inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory 
      cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), effects particularly relevant for treatment-resistant 
      cases with elevated baseline inflammation. The therapeutic potential of these 
      immunoregulatory effects is supported by emerging interventions, including 
      low-dose IL-2 immunotherapy, vagus nerve stimulation, and microbiota-targeted 
      therapies, which show promise for specific depression subtypes. Importantly, 
      these approaches appear most effective when guided by inflammatory biomarkers, 
      suggesting a path toward personalized treatment strategies. By integrating 
      findings from clinical studies and translational research, this work establishes 
      immune modulation as a fundamental component of antidepressant action. The review 
      provides a framework for developing next-generation treatments that target 
      neuroimmune pathways in MDD, with particular emphasis on practical applications 
      for treatment-resistant cases. These insights bridge the gap between 
      neuropharmacology and clinical psychiatry, offering new therapeutic possibilities 
      for patients with inflammation-associated depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor driven by 
      glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which represent an appealing target for 
      therapeutic interventions. The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), a scaffold 
      protein involved in diverse cellular processes, interacts with various membrane 
      and extracellular matrix molecules, influencing tumor biology. Herein, we 
      investigate the impact of PrP(C) expression on GBM. METHODS: To address this 
      goal, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate PrP(C) knockout (KO) 
      glioblastoma cell lines, enabling detailed loss-of-function studies. Bulk RNA 
      sequencing followed by differentially expressed gene and pathway enrichment 
      analyses between U87 or U251 PrP(C)-wild-type (WT) cells and PrP(C)-knockout (KO) 
      cells were used to identify pathways regulated by PrP(C). Immunofluorescence 
      assays were used to evaluate cellular morphology and protein distribution. For 
      assessment of protein levels, Western blot and flow cytometry assays were 
      employed. Transwell and growth curve assays were used to determine the impact of 
      loss-of-PrP(C) in GBM invasiveness and proliferation, respectively. Single-cell 
      RNA sequencing analysis of data from patient tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) and the Broad Institute of Single-Cell Data Portal were used to evaluate 
      the correspondence between our in vitro results and patient samples. RESULTS: 
      Transcriptome analysis of PrP(C)-KO GBM cell lines revealed altered expression of 
      genes associated with crucial tumor progression pathways, including migration, 
      proliferation, and stemness. These findings were corroborated by assays that 
      revealed impaired invasion, migration, proliferation, and self-renewal in 
      PrP(C)-KO GBM cells, highlighting its critical role in sustaining tumor growth. 
      Notably, loss-of-PrP(C) disrupted the expression and localization of key stemness 
      markers, particularly CD44. Additionally, the modulation of PrP(C) levels through 
      CD44 overexpression further emphasizes their regulatory role in these processes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish PrP(C) as a modulator of essential 
      molecules on the cell surface of GSCs, highlighting its potential as a 
      therapeutic target for GBM.

AB  - In the 2018 yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil, we generated new transcriptomic 
      data and combined it with clinical and immunological data to decode the 
      pathogenesis of YF. Analyzing 79 patients, we found distinct gene expression 
      patterns between acute YF, other viral infections, and the milder YF-17D vaccine 
      infection. We identified a critical role for low-density, immature neutrophils in 
      severe outcomes, marked by the downregulation of genes essential for neutrophil 
      migration and maturation, such as PADI4, CSF3R, and ICAM1, in deceased patients. 
      Our study also revealed complex interactions among inflammation-related genes, 
      including increased CXCL10 and IL1R2 expression and decreased IL-1b expression in 
      the acute phase. The diminished expression of HLA class II genes indicates 
      impaired antigen presentation. These findings highlight the delicate balance of 
      immune responses in YF pathogenesis and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic 
      and diagnostic advancements.

TI  - Sex-Based Differences in Thyroid Plasma B Cell Infiltration: Implications for 
      Autoimmune Disease Susceptibility.
LID - bqae148 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/endocr/bqae148 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease, 
      are significantly more prevalent in women than in men, suggesting underlying 
      biological differences in immune system function and regulation between sexes. 
      Plasma B cells are crucial in autoimmunity due to their role in producing 
      antibodies targeting self-antigens, but their presence in the thyroids of women 
      without clinical autoimmune diseases remains largely unexplored. This study 
      investigates the infiltration of plasma B cells in female thyroids specifically 
      excluding those with any clinical signs of autoimmune diseases. Using bulk 
      RNA-seq analysis, we identified significant sex differences in gene expression 
      profiles, particularly in genes associated with plasma B cells. Single-cell 
      RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analyses further revealed that the 
      CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling axis plays a pivotal role in recruiting and organizing 
      plasma B cells within the thyroid tissue. These findings suggest that the 
      inherent presence of plasma B cells in the female thyroid, driven by CXCL13, may 
      contribute to the higher risk of developing autoimmune thyroid diseases in women. 
      Our study provides new insights into the immune landscape of the thyroid and 
      underscores the importance of understanding sex-specific differences in immune 
      cell distribution and function.

AB  - Brain metastasis is the most common type of brain cancer, associated with 
      significant neurological dysfunction and a poor prognosis. We investigated the 
      transcriptome of 128,421 single-cells of 36 brain metastases, originating from a 
      variety of primary tumors, including melanoma, breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, 
      and renal cancers. Our aim was to identify common molecular factors across these 
      tumors, shedding light on key interactions that facilitate tumor establishment in 
      the brain. We specifically focused on the dynamics of the blood-tumor barrier and 
      its effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Our analysis decoded 
      complex cell-cell communications, emphasizing the crucial role of astrocytes in 
      the tumor microenvironment (TME). This provided insights into how these 
      interactions impact the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier and contribute to 
      the development of brain metastases. We identified the VEGFA, SEMA3, and SPP1 
      pathways as key regulators in brain metastasis, affecting vascular permeability 
      and cellular dynamics. Spatial transcriptome analysis confirmed our findings and 
      linked these pathways to TME enrichment. The pronounced expression of VEGFA by 
      cancer cells suggests a significant activation of angiogenic pathways, 
      influencing vascular responses and the intricate architecture of brain tissue. 
      The interplay of these signaling pathways underlines the complexity of molecular 
      interactions that define the microenvironment of brain metastases.

AB  - The study of multifactorial and complex interactions in human diseases has been 
      transformed by the omics revolution. The speed and scale of omics analysis have 
      increased exponentially in the past decades, and it is now easier and faster to 
      generate large amounts of biological data. However, extracting meaningful 
      information from this “sea of data” remains a major challenge. The field of 
      integrative biology utilizes a holistic approach to integrate multilayer 
      biological data. In this chapter, we introduce concepts and techniques for the 
      analysis of single-layer omics data and for integrating multilayer omics datasets 
      to extract meaningful and relevant biological insights. Integrative biology is a 
      promising approach for the study of a wide range of human diseases. We also 
      highlight some current challenges in the field, such as the need for more 
      specialized and interpretable methods, while increasing the accessibility of 
      integrative analysis for the scientific community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reduced life expectancy observed in individuals with 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. 
      Emerging evidence suggests that astrocytic dysfunction and immune-inflammatory 
      processes contribute to SCZ pathophysiology. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX), an 
      established immunomodulatory drug used for non-neurological conditions, 
      demonstrated antipsychotic potential in early SCZ. However, the underlying 
      mechanisms remain unknown. AIMS: This study aimed to identify molecular targets 
      of MTX within SCZ-relevant pathways, focusing on astrocytic and neuroimmune 
      networks using in silico bioinformatics analysis and a rodent model for SCZ. 
      METHODS: In silico analysis: A bioinformatics-based approach was employed, 
      integrating cognitive computing-generated knowledge graphs, modular co-expression 
      analysis, and gene-drug interaction databases with a machine learning-based 
      text-mining tool. Rodent model: The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801-induced mouse 
      model for SCZ was used to assess MTX's therapeutic potential, compared to 
      clozapine. Behavioural outcomes (sociability and cognition) and astrocytic 
      reactivity (GFAP expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: In silico: MTX preferentially targeted hub genes within 
      astrocyte and NFκB modules. In astrocytes, MTX modulated NT5E, a key regulator of 
      adenosine metabolism. In the NFκB module, MTX interacted with IL-6 and STAT3, 
      both involved in immune regulation. Rodent model: MK-801 administration impaired 
      sociability and cognition, accompanied by increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in 
      the prelimbic mPFC, both of which were prevented by MTX. The neuroimmunomodulator 
      effect of MTX was comparable to clozapine in both the in silico and rodent model. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the potential 
      antipsychotic-like effects of low-dose MTX in SCZ, involving astrocytic 
      modulation and immune regulation. Further experimental medicine studies in 
      clinical populations stratified by astrocytic and neuroinflammatory biomarkers 
      are warranted to validate these findings.

TI  - In vitro morphological profiling of T cells predicts clinical response to 
      natalizumab therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 5533

AB  - Despite the efficacy of natalizumab, which targets the integrin VLA-4, in 
      treating multiple sclerosis (MS), approximately 35% patients with MS present 
      evidence of disease activity two years after treatment initiation. Individual 
      heterogeneity of leukocyte response to VLA-4 on natalizumab-mediated blockade may 
      underlie disparities in treatment efficacy. Here we use a high-content cell 
      imaging (HCI) pipeline to profile the in vitro effects of natalizumab on 
      VLA-4-stimulated PBMCs from MS patients prior to natalizumab treatment. 
      Unsupervised clustering of image data partially discriminates non-responder MS 
      patients based on morphology, F-actin organization and signaling-related features 
      in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, through a random forest approach, treatment 
      response can be predicted with a performance of 92% for a discovery cohort and 
      88% for a validation cohort. Unfavorable treatment response is associated with a 
      distinct actin remodeling response of natalizumab-exposed CD8(+) T cells and a 
      residual ability of these cells to spread on VCAM-1. Our study thus unveils that 
      CD8(+) T cells from individual MS patients display heterogeneous susceptibility 
      to natalizumab in vitro and highlights the potential of HCI-based pretreatment 
      monitoring to assist individualized treatment prescription.

AB  - Despite the considerable advances in the last years, the health information 
      systems for health surveillance still need to overcome some critical issues so 
      that epidemic detection can be performed in real time. For instance, despite the 
      efforts of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) to make COVID-19 data available 
      during the pandemic, delays due to data entry and data availability posed an 
      additional threat to disease monitoring. Here, we propose a complementary 
      approach by using electronic medical records (EMRs) data collected in real time 
      to generate a system to enable insights from the local health surveillance system 
      personnel. As a proof of concept, we assessed data from São Caetano do Sul City 
      (SCS), São Paulo, Brazil. We used the "fever" term as a sentinel event. Regular 
      expression techniques were applied to detect febrile diseases. Other specific 
      terms such as "malaria," "dengue," "Zika," or any infectious disease were 
      included in the dictionary and mapped to "fever." Additionally, after 
      "tokenizing," we assessed the frequencies of most mentioned terms when fever was 
      also mentioned in the patient complaint. The findings allowed us to detect the 
      overlapping outbreaks of both COVID-19 Omicron BA.1 subvariant and Influenza A 
      virus, which were confirmed by our team by analyzing data from private 
      laboratories and another COVID-19 public monitoring system. Timely information 
      generated from EMRs will be a very important tool to the decision-making process 
      as well as research in epidemiology. Quality and security on the data produced is 
      of paramount importance to allow the use by health surveillance systems.

TI  - Integrative mapping of preexisting influenza immune landscapes predicts vaccine 
      response.
LID - 10.1172/JCI189300 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUNDPredicting individual vaccine responses is a substantial public health 
      challenge. We developed Immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework for 
      systems vaccinologists to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across 
      diverse vaccination settings, beyond traditional assessments.METHODSUsing a 
      comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) dataset from 244 Gambian 
      children, Immunaut integrated prevaccination and postvaccination humoral, 
      mucosal, cellular, and transcriptomic data. Through advanced modeling, our 
      framework provided a holistic, systems-level view of LAIV-induced 
      immunity.RESULTSThe analysis identified 3 distinct immunophenotypic profiles 
      driven by baseline immunity: (a) CD8+ T cell responders with strong preexisting 
      immunity boosting memory T cell responses; (b) mucosal responders with prior 
      influenza A virus immunity developing robust mucosal IgA and subsequent influenza 
      B virus seroconversion; and (c) systemic, broad influenza A virus responders 
      starting from immune naivety who mounted broad systemic antibody responses. 
      Pathway analysis revealed how preexisting immune landscapes and baseline 
      features, such as mucosal preparedness and cellular support, quantitatively 
      dictate vaccine outcomes.CONCLUSIONOur findings emphasize the power of 
      integrative, predictive frameworks for advancing precision vaccinology. The 
      Immunaut framework is a valuable resource for deciphering vaccine response 
      heterogeneity and can be applied to optimize immunization strategies across 
      diverse populations and vaccine platforms.FUNDINGWellcome Trust (110058/Z/15/Z);

TI  - Is the gut microbiome key to modulating vaccine efficacy?
PG  - 777-9
LID - 10.1586/14760584.2015.1040395 [doi]
AB  - A symbiotic relationship with gut microbes is critical for the normal function of 
      human health. Vaccination, however, tips the symbiotic balance slightly in favor 
      of human health. Recent work has shown that gut bacterial residents can have 
      great (positive) influence over vaccine-induced immunity. With an arsenal of 
      modern high-throughput technologies in the hands of microbiologists and 
      immunologists, it is now easier and more cost-effective than ever to characterize 
      and measure the microbiome of vaccinees. Such data will lead to an understanding 
      of how and to what extent gut microbes can impact vaccine efficacy.

LID - 20140146
AB  - Vaccination has been tremendously successful saving lives and preventing 
      infections. However, the development of vaccines against global pandemics such as 
      HIV, malaria and tuberculosis has been obstructed by several challenges. A major 
      challenge is the lack of knowledge about the correlates and mechanisms of 
      protective immunity. Recent advances in the application of systems biological 
      approaches to analyse immune responses to vaccination in humans are beginning to 
      yield new insights about mechanisms of vaccine immunity, and to define molecular 
      signatures, induced rapidly after vaccination, that correlate with and predict 
      vaccine induced immunity. Here, we review these advances and discuss the 
      potential of this systems vaccinology approach in defining novel correlates of 
      protection in clinical trials, and in infection-induced 'experimental challenge 
      models' in humans.

LID - 146
AB  - Co-expression analysis has been widely used to elucidate the functional 
      architecture of genes under different biological processes. Such analysis, 
      however, requires substantial knowledge about programming languages and/or 
      bioinformatics skills. We present webCEMiTool, a unique online tool that performs 
      comprehensive modular analyses in a fully automated manner. The webCEMiTool not 
      only identifies co-expression gene modules but also performs several functional 
      analyses on them. In addition, webCEMiTool integrates transcriptomic data with 
      interactome information (i.e., protein-protein interactions) and identifies 
      potential hubs on each network. The tool generates user-friendly html reports 
      that allow users to search for specific genes in each module, as well as check if 
      a module contains genes overrepresented in specific pathways or altered in a 
      specific sample phenotype. We used webCEMiTool to perform a modular analysis of 
      single-cell RNA-seq data of human cells infected with either Zika virus or dengue 
      virus.

TI  - As antisense RNA gets intronic.
PG  - 2-12
AB  - Recent work describing the transcriptional output of the human genome points to 
      the existence of a significant number of non-coding RNA transcripts coming from 
      intronic regions, with a fraction of these being oriented antisense relative to 
      the protein-coding mRNA of the known gene. In this article, we survey the main 
      findings of the large-scale expression analysis projects that led to the 
      identification of antisense intronic messages and which demonstrate their 
      ubiquitous expression in the human genome. We review the current knowledge on 
      long, unspliced, intronic antisense transcripts, a new class of non-coding RNAs, 
      recently described by our group to be correlated with the degree of tumor 
      differentiation in prostate cancer, which we postulate is involved in the fine 
      tuning of gene expression in eukaryotes. Possible mechanisms of antisense 
      intronic transcript biogenesis and function in gene expression regulation are 
      discussed, as is their involvement in human diseases. While there is still no 
      conclusive evidence demonstrating a functional role for these long, intronic 
      antisense messages, the far-reaching implications of their existence for the 
      mechanisms regulating gene expression certainly warrant further experimentation.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization in the upper respiratory tract is linked to 
      pneumococcal disease development, predominantly affecting young children and 
      older adults. As the global population ages and comorbidities increase, there is 
      a heightened concern about this infection. We investigated the immunological 
      responses of older adults to pneumococcal-controlled human infection by analyzing 
      the cellular composition and gene expression in the nasal mucosa. Our comparative 
      analysis with data from a concurrent study in younger adults revealed distinct 
      gene expression patterns in older individuals susceptible to colonization, 
      highlighted by neutrophil activation and elevated levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. 
      Unlike younger adults challenged with pneumococcus, older adults did not show 
      recruitment of monocytes into the nasal mucosa following nasal colonization. 
      However, older adults who were protected from colonization showed increased 
      degranulation of cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, both before and after 
      pneumococcal challenge. These findings suggest age-associated cellular changes, 
      in particular enhanced mucosal inflammation, that may predispose older adults to 
      pneumococcal colonization.

TI  - Systems Vaccinology Applied to DNA Vaccines: Perspective and Challenges.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - DNA vaccination represents a new milestone in our technological efforts to avoid 
      infectious diseases. Although this method of vaccination has had success in 
      providing protection in animals, these vaccines suffer from low immunogenicity in 
      humans. Questions remain over the molecular mechanism of DNA vaccination, the 
      best ways in which to safely increase vaccine reactogenecity, and what biomarkers 
      can be used as correlates of protection. Systems vaccinology, which utilizes 
      modern experimental and computational approaches to provide an integrated view of 
      the vaccination process, offers the potential to answer these questions. In this 
      review we discuss the current tools utilized in systems vaccinology, the ways in 
      which they have and can be applied to DNA vaccinology, and challenges faced in 
      the field.

TI  - CASP4/11 Contributes to NLRP3 Activation and COVID-19 Exacerbation.
PG  - 1364-1375
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiad037 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection triggers 
      activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which promotes inflammation and aggravates 
      severe COVID-19. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 induces upregulation and 
      activation of human caspase-4/CASP4 (mouse caspase-11/CASP11), and this process 
      contributes to NLRP3 activation. In vivo infections performed in transgenic hACE2 
      humanized mice, deficient or sufficient for Casp11, indicate that hACE2 Casp11-/- 
      mice were protected from disease development, with the increased pulmonary 
      parenchymal area, reduced clinical score of the disease, and reduced mortality. 
      Assessing human samples from fatal cases of COVID-19, we found that CASP4 was 
      expressed in patient lungs and correlated with the expression of inflammasome 
      components and inflammatory mediators, including CASP1, IL1B, IL18, and IL6. 
      Collectively, our data establish that CASP4/11 promotes NLRP3 activation and 
      disease pathology, revealing a possible target for therapeutic interventions for 
      COVID-19.

AB  - A diverse set of phage lineages is associated with the bacterial plant-pathogen 
      genomes sequenced to date. Analysis of 37 genomes revealed 5,169 potential genes 
      (approximately 4.3 Mbp) of phage origin, and at least 50% had no function 
      assigned or are nonessential to phage biology. Some phytopathogens have 
      transcriptionally active prophage genes under conditions that mimic plant 
      infection, suggesting an association between plant disease and prophage 
      transcriptional modulation. The role of prophages within genomes for cell biology 
      varies. For pathogens such as Pectobacterium, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and 
      Streptomyces, involvement of prophage in disease symptoms has been demonstrated. 
      In Xylella and Xanthomonas, prophage activity is associated with genome 
      rearrangements and strain differentiation. For other pathogens, prophage roles 
      are yet to be established. This review integrates available information in a 
      unique interface ( http://propnav.esalq.usp.br ) that may be assessed to improve 
      research in prophage biology and its association with genome evolution and 
      pathogenicity.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 uses CD4 to infect T helper lymphocytes.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.84790 [doi]
LID - e84790
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of 
      a major global outbreak of respiratory tract disease known as Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects mainly lungs and may cause several 
      immune-related complications, such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm, which 
      are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality. The 
      mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction 
      is still not fully understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4(+) 
      T helper cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, and is present in blood and 
      bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We 
      demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 
      molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells. This 
      leads to impaired CD4 T cell function and may cause cell death. 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected T helper cells express higher levels of IL-10, which is 
      associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may contribute to a poor immune response 
      in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Gene regulatory networks analysis for the discovery of prognostic genes in 
      gliomas.
PG  - 14034

AB  - Gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary tumors of the central nervous 
      system. Dysregulated transcription factors (TFs) and genes have been implicated 
      in glioma progression, yet these tumors' overall structure of gene regulatory 
      networks (GRNs) remains undefined. We analyzed transcriptional data from 989 
      primary gliomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome 
      Atlas (CGGA) to address this. GRNs were reconstructed using the RTN package which 
      identifies regulons-sets of genes regulated by a common TF based on co-expression 
      and mutual information. Regulon activity was evaluated through Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis. Elastic net regularization and Cox regression identified 31 
      and 32 prognostic genes in the TCGA and CGGA datasets, respectively, with 11 
      genes overlapping, many of which are associated with neural development and 
      synaptic processes. GAS2L3, HOXD13, and OTP demonstrated the strongest 
      correlations with survival outcomes among these. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 
      201,986 cells revealed distinct expression patterns for these genes in glioma 
      subpopulations, particularly oligoprogenitor cells. This study uncovers key GRNs 
      and prognostic genes in gliomas, offering new insights into tumor biology and 
      potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a wide spectrum of symptoms, the 
      causes of which remain poorly understood. This study explored the associations 
      between autoantibodies (AABs), particularly those targeting G protein-coupled 
      receptors (GPCRs) and renin‒angiotensin system (RAS) molecules, and the clinical 
      manifestations of COVID-19. Using a cross-sectional analysis of 244 individuals, 
      we applied multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, and 
      multinomial regression to examine the relationships between AAB levels and key 
      symptoms. Significant correlations were identified between specific AABs and 
      symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Notably, anti-AGTR1 
      antibodies, which contribute to endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation, a 
      process reversed by losartan, have emerged as strong predictors of core symptoms. 
      AAB levels increased with symptom accumulation, peaking in patients exhibiting 
      all four key symptoms. These findings highlight the role of AABs, particularly 
      anti-AGTR1 antibodies, in determining symptom severity and suggest their 
      involvement in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including vascular complications.

TI  - Systems biology of vaccination in the elderly.
PG  - 117-42
LID - 10.1007/82_2012_250 [doi]
AB  - Aging population demographics, combined with suboptimal vaccine responses in the 
      elderly, make the improvement of vaccination strategies in the elderly a 
      developing public health issue. The immune system changes with age, with innate 
      and adaptive cell components becoming increasingly dysfunctional. As such, 
      vaccine responses in the elderly are impaired in ways that differ depending on 
      the type of vaccine (e.g., live attenuated, polysaccharide, conjugate, or 
      subunit) and the mediators of protection (e.g., antibody and/or T cell). The 
      rapidly progressing field of systems biology has been shown to be useful in 
      predicting immunogenicity and offering insights into potential mechanisms of 
      protection in young adults. Future application of systems biology to vaccination 
      in the elderly may help to identify gene signatures that predict suboptimal 
      responses and help to identify more accurate correlates of protection. Moreover, 
      the identification of specific defects may be used to target novel vaccination 
      strategies that improve efficacy in elderly populations.

AB  - Two years ago, we held an exciting event entitled the São Paulo School of 
      Advanced Sciences on Vaccines (SPSASV). Sixty-eight Ph.D. students, postdoctoral 
      fellows and independent researchers from 37 different countries met at the Mendes 
      Plaza Hotel located in the city of Santos, SP - Brazil to discuss the challenges 
      and the new frontiers of vaccinology. The SPSASV provided a critical and 
      comprehensive view of vaccine research from basics to the current 
      state-of-the-art techniques performed worldwide. For 10 days, we discussed all 
      the aspects of vaccine development in 36 lectures, 53 oral presentations and 2 
      poster sessions. At the end of the course, participants were further encouraged 
      to present a model of a grant proposal related to vaccine development against 
      individual pathogens. Among the targeted pathogens were viruses (Chikungunya,

TI  - ACE2 Expression Is Increased in the Lungs of Patients With Comorbidities 
      Associated With Severe COVID-19.

AB  - Patients who died from COVID-19 often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, 
      diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Although angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and enter host cells, no study 
      has systematically assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with 
      these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples from 
      patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 
      was highly expressed in these patients compared to control individuals. This 
      finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of 
      developing severe COVID-19. Correlation and network analyses revealed many 
      potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to 
      histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. Our systems biology 
      approach offers a possible explanation for increased COVID-19 severity in 
      patients with certain comorbidities.

AB  - Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune 
      responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems 
      vaccinology can combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain 
      highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. 
      Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers 
      with no background in bioinformatics. Here we described the four main steps to 
      discover markers of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity: (1) Preparing the 
      data; (2) Selecting the vaccinees and relevant genes; (3) Choosing the algorithm; 
      (4) Blind testing your model. With the increasing number of Systems Vaccinology 
      datasets being generated, we expect that the accuracy and robustness of 
      signatures of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity will significantly 
      improve.

TI  - The single-cell transcriptome of mTECs and CD4(+) thymocytes under adhesion 
      revealed heterogeneity of mTECs and a network controlled by Aire and lncRNAs.

AB  - To further understand the impact of deficiency of the autoimmune regulator (Aire) 
      gene during the adhesion of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to 
      thymocytes, we sequenced single-cell libraries (scRNA-seq) obtained from Aire 
      wild-type (WT) (Aire(wt/wt) ) or Aire-deficient (Aire(wt/mut) ) mTECs cocultured 
      with WT single-positive (SP) CD4(+) thymocytes. Although the libraries differed 
      in their mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiles, indicating that mTECs 
      were heterogeneous in terms of their transcriptome, UMAP clustering revealed that 
      both mTEC lines expressed their specific markers, i.e., Epcam, Itgb4, Itga6, and 
      Casp3 in resting mTECs and Ccna2, Pbk, and Birc5 in proliferative mTECs. Both 
      cocultured SP CD4(+) thymocytes remained in a homogeneous cluster expressing the 
      Il7r and Ccr7 markers. Comparisons of the two types of cocultures revealed the 
      differential expression of mRNAs that encode transcription factors (Zfpm2, Satb1, 
      and Lef1), cell adhesion genes (Itgb1) in mTECs, and Themis in thymocytes, which 
      is associated with the regulation of positive and negative selection. At the 
      single-cell sequencing resolution, we observed that Aire acts on both Aire WT and 
      Aire-deficient mTECs as an upstream controller of mRNAs, which encode 
      transcription factors or adhesion proteins that, in turn, are 
      posttranscriptionally controlled by lncRNAs, for example, Neat1, Malat1, Pvt1, 
      and Dancr among others. Under Aire deficiency, mTECs dysregulate the expression 
      of MHC-II, CD80, and CD326 (EPCAM) protein markers as well as metabolism and cell 
      cycle-related mRNAs, which delay the cell cycle progression. Moreover, when 
      adhered to mTECs, WT SP CD4(+) or CD8(+) thymocytes modulate the expression of 
      cell activation proteins, including CD28 and CD152/CTLA4, and the expression of 
      cellular metabolism mRNAs. These findings indicate a complex mechanism through 
      which an imbalance in Aire expression can affect mTECs and thymocytes during 
      adhesion.

TI  - Replication, safety and immunogenicity of the vectored Ebola vaccine 
      rVSV-ΔG-ZEBOV-GP in a sub-Saharan African paediatric population: A randomised 
      controlled, open-label trial in children aged 1-12 years living in Lambaréné, 
      Gabon.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unlike adults, children experienced stronger and longer vector 
      replication in plasma and shedding in saliva following rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP 
      vaccination. The resulting risks of immunosuppression or immune hyperactivation 
      leading to increased Adverse Events (AEs) and altered antibody responses are 
      concerns that have been addressed in the present manuscript. METHODS: Children 
      aged 1-12 years living in Gabon received either rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (ERVEBO®) vaccine 
      or the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (VZV). The concentration of rVSVΔG 
      vector in blood and saliva, the occurrence of AEs up to day 28; the 
      anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP and anti-VZV IgG antibody titres, neutralising and avidity 
      functions of anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP by day 365; were assessed in serum. 
      (PACTR202005733552021) FINDINGS: In the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, 70% and 7% of 
      children had >0 copies/ml of rVSVΔG respectively in plasma by day 3 and in saliva 
      by day 14 after vaccination, with no detection on day 28. Significantly higher 
      but transient AEs occurred in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group. Both vaccines induced 
      seroconversion on day 28 and sustainable IgG antibody titres by day 365. Avidity 
      and neutralisation functions of the anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP antibodies peaked at day 
      28 and were maintained by day 365. INTERPRETATION: The replication and shedding 
      do not affect the favourable risk-benefit balance of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in 
      children.

AB  - Squalene-based emulsion (SE) adjuvants like MF59 and AS03 are used in protein 
      subunit vaccines against influenza virus (e.g., Fluad, Pandemrix, Arepanrix) and 
      SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Covifenz, SKYCovione). We demonstrate the critical role of uric 
      acid (UA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), in triggering 
      immunogenicity by SE adjuvants. In mice, SE adjuvants elevated DAMP levels in 
      draining lymph nodes. Strikingly, inhibition of UA synthesis reduced 
      vaccine-induced innate immunity, subsequently impairing optimal antibody and T 
      cell responses. In vivo treatment with UA crystals elicited partial adjuvant 
      effects. In vitro stimulation with UA crystals augmented the activation of 
      dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and altered multiple pathways in these cells, 
      including inflammation and antigen presentation in DCs and cell proliferation in 
      B cells. In an influenza vaccine model, UA contributed to protection against 
      influenza viral infection. These results demonstrate the importance of DAMPs, 
      specifically the versatile role of UA in the immunogenicity of SE adjuvants, by 
      regulating DCs and B cells.

      tuberculosis with single-cell gene expression effects.

AB  - Although genetic factors contribute to tuberculosis (TB) risk, no 
      cross-population causal variants have been identified by genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS). Here, we utilized low-pass whole genome sequencing (lpWGS) with 
      imputation plus detailed epidemiologic risk factors and single-cell expression 
      quantitative loci (sceQTL) to address prior GWAS limitations. Using 947 pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (PTB) cases and 1807 close contact controls in the Regional 
      Prospective Observational Research in TB (RePORT) study in Brazil, we estimated 
      PTB heritability to be 47.7%. We identified 19 SNPs associated with PTB (P<5E-8) 
      after adjustment for major risk factors (HIV, diabetes, smoking). Seven of these 
      SNPs were associated with peripheral blood cell-specific sceQTLs in controls. 
      Specifically, SNPs cis to transcription factors ZNF717 and MAML3 were associated 
      with PTB disease and gene expression in monocytes, T cells, or B cells. Overall, 
      this study utilized lpWGS, in-depth epidemiology, and single-cell analyses to 
      detect population-specific genetic risk factors for PTB in Brazil. SUMMARY: 
      Robust correction for tuberculosis risk factors in GWAS in combination with 
      paired single-cell transcriptomics reveals novel genetic risk of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis with measurable consequences for baseline gene expression in 
      multiple cell types.

AB  - Vaccines have drastically reduced the mortality and morbidity of many diseases. 
      However, vaccines have historically been developed empirically, and recent 
      development of vaccines against current pandemics such as HIV and malaria has 
      been met with difficulty. The advent of high-throughput technologies, coupled 
      with systems biological methods of data analysis, has enabled researchers to 
      interrogate the entire complement of a variety of molecular components within 
      cells, and characterize the myriad interactions among them in order to model and 
      understand the behavior of the system as a whole. In the context of vaccinology, 
      these tools permit exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines 
      induce protective immune responses. Here we review the recent advances, 
      challenges, and potential of systems biological approaches in vaccinology. If the 
      challenges facing this developing field can be overcome, systems vaccinology 
      promises to empower the identification of early predictive signatures of vaccine 
      response, as well as novel and robust correlates of protection from infection. 
      Such discoveries, along with the improved understanding of immune responses to 
      vaccination they impart, will play an instrumental role in development of the 
      next generation of rationally designed vaccines.

AB  - Refined control of intrinsic and extrinsic signals is critical for specific 
      neuronal differentiation. Here, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (hiPSCs) from three different healthy donors into neural stem cells (NSCs) 
      and floor plate progenitors (FPPs; progenitors of dopaminergic neurons) and 
      further performed intracellular and extracellular vesicles' (EVs) miRNA 
      profiling. While NSC and FPP cells differed significantly in levels of only 8 
      intracellular miRNAs, their differences were more evident in the EV miRNAs with 
      27 differentially expressed miRNAs. Target validation of intracellular miRNAs 
      revealed that FPPs expressed more EXOC5 mRNA than NSCs, which is implicated in 
      the function of primary cilia, an essential signaling organelle in FPPs. 
      Moreover, we found a group of 5 miRNAs consistently enriched in EVs from these 
      three cell types. This study presents a foundation for the field of miRNA 
      regulation in neural development and provides new insights for disease modeling 
      and regenerative medicine.

AB  - Predicting individual vaccine responses remains a significant challenge due to 
      the complexity and variability of immune processes. To address this gap, we 
      developed immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework implemented as an R 
      package specifically designed for all systems vaccinologists seeking to analyze 
      and predict immunological outcomes across diverse vaccination settings. 
      Leveraging one of the most comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) 
      datasets to date - 244 Gambian children enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity 
      study - immunaut integrates humoral, mucosal, cellular, transcriptomic, and 
      microbiological parameters collected before and after vaccination, providing an 
      unprecedentedly holistic view of LAIV-induced immunity. Through advanced 
      dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling, immunaut 
      identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder profiles and their underlying 
      baseline determinants. In this study, immunaut delineated three immunophenotypes: 
      (1) CD8 T-cell responders, marked by strong baseline mucosal immunity and 
      extensive prior influenza virus exposure that boosts memory CD8 T-cell responses, 
      without generating influenza virus-specific antibody responses; (2) Mucosal 
      responders, characterized by pre-existing systemic influenza A virus immunity 
      (specifically to H3N2) and stable epithelial integrity, leading to potent mucosal 
      IgA expansions and subsequent seroconversion to influenza B virus; and (3) 
      Systemic, broad influenza A virus responders, who start with relatively naive 
      immunity and leverage greater initial viral replication to drive broad systemic 
      antibody responses against multiple influenza A virus variants beyond those 
      included in the LAIV vaccine. By integrating pathway-level analysis, 
      model-derived contribution scores, and hierarchical decision rules, immunaut 
      elucidates how distinct immunological landscapes shape each response trajectory 
      and how key baseline features, including pre-existing immunity, mucosal 
      preparedness, and cellular support, dictate vaccine outcomes. Collectively, these 
      findings emphasize the power of integrative, predictive frameworks to advance 
      precision vaccinology, and highlight immunaut as a versatile, community-available 
      resource for optimizing immunization strategies across diverse populations and 
      vaccine platforms.

TI  - Androgen responsive intronic non-coding RNAs.
PG  - 4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcription of large numbers of non-coding RNAs originating from 
      intronic regions of human genes has been recently reported, but mechanisms 
      governing their biosynthesis and biological functions are largely unknown. In 
      this work, we evaluated the existence of a common mechanism of transcription 
      regulation shared by protein-coding mRNAs and intronic RNAs by measuring the 
      effect of androgen on the transcriptional profile of a prostate cancer cell line. 
      RESULTS: Using a custom-built cDNA microarray enriched in intronic transcribed 
      sequences, we found 39 intronic non-coding RNAs for which levels were 
      significantly regulated by androgen exposure. Orientation-specific reverse 
      transcription-PCR indicated that 10 of the 13 were transcribed in the antisense 
      direction. These transcripts are long (0.5-5 kb), unspliced and apparently do not 
      code for proteins. Interestingly, we found that the relative levels of 
      androgen-regulated intronic transcripts could be correlated with the levels of 
      the corresponding protein-coding gene (asGAS6 and asDNAJC3) or with the 
      alternative usage of exons (asKDELR2 and asITGA6) in the corresponding 
      protein-coding transcripts. Binding of the androgen receptor to a putative 
      regulatory region upstream from asMYO5A, an androgen-regulated antisense intronic 
      transcript, was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. CONCLUSION: 
      Altogether, these results indicate that at least a fraction of naturally 
      transcribed intronic non-coding RNAs may be regulated by common physiological 
      signals such as hormones, and further corroborate the notion that the intronic 
      complement of the transcriptome play functional roles in the human 
      gene-expression program.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uveitis accounts for up to 25% of global legal blindness and 
      involves intraocular inflammation, classifed as infectious or non-infectious. Its 
      complex pathophysiology includes dysregulated cytokines, particularly interferons 
      (IFNs). However, the global signature of type I, II, and III interferon-regulated 
      genes (Interferome) remains largely uncharacterized in uveitis. METHODS: In this 
      study, we conducted an integrative systems biology analysis of blood 
      transcriptome data from 169 non-infectious uveitis patients (56 isolated uveitis, 
      113 systemic disease-associated uveitis) and 82 healthy controls. RESULTS: 
      Modular co-expression analysis identified distinct cytokine signaling networks, 
      emphasizing interleukin and interferon pathways. A meta-analysis revealed 110 
      differentially expressed genes (metaDEGs) in isolated uveitis and 91 in systemic 
      disease-associated uveitis, predominantly linked to immune responses. The 
      Interferome database confirmed a predominance of type I and II IFN signatures in 
      both groups. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted inflammatory responses, 
      including cytokine production (IL-8, IL1-β, IFN-γ, β, and α) and toll-like 
      receptor signaling (TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, CD180). Principal component analysis 
      emphasized the IFN signature's discriminative power, particularly in systemic 
      disease-associated uveitis. Machine learning identified IFN-associated genes as 
      robust predictors, while linear discriminant analysis pinpointed CCR2, CD180, 
      GAPT, and PTGS2 as key risk factors in isolated uveitis and CA1, SIAH2, and PGS 
      in systemic disease-associated uveitis. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight 
      IFN-driven imune dysregulation and potential molecular targets for precision 
      therapies in uveitis.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection often results in a chronic joint condition 
      known as Post-Chikungunya Chronic Inflammatory Joint Disease (pCHIKV-CIJD). This 
      condition disrupts individuals' daily lives and contributes to increased 
      healthcare expenditure. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying pCHIKV-CIJD development by analyzing RNA transcripts, including small 
      RNAs, of whole blood from CHIKV-infected patients. By comparing patients who 
      evolved to pCHIKV-CIJD with those who did not, we identified molecular signatures 
      associated with chronification in acute and post-acute disease phases. These 
      molecules were primarily associated with an altered immune response regulation. 
      Notably, LIFR, an immune receptor that enhanced IL-6 transcription, was 
      down-regulated in the acute phase of pCHIKV-CIJD patients, while its inhibitor, 
      hsa-miR-98-5p, was up-regulated in these individuals. Other downregulated genes 
      include members of immune mechanisms whose impairment can lead to a reduction in 
      the first line of antiviral response, thereby promoting virus persistence for a 
      longer period in these patients. Additionally, pCHIKV-CIJD patients exhibited 
      reduced transcript levels of MMP8, LFT, and DDIT4, genes already implicated in 
      the pathological process of other types of inflammatory arthritis and seemingly 
      relevant for pCHIKV-CIJD development. Overall, our findings provide insights into 
      the early molecular mechanisms involved in the chronification and highlight 
      potential targets for further investigation.

TI  - MS-Driven Metabolic Alterations Are Recapitulated in iPSC-Derived Astrocytes.
PG  - 652-669

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells 
      were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As 
      there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to 
      better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on 
      mitochondrial function and cell metabolism. METHODS: We obtained and 
      characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three 
      PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow 
      cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, in situ 
      respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei 
      RNA sequencing dataset. RESULTS: We detected several differences in MS astrocytes 
      including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) 
      increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and 
      MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release 
      of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line 
      with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with 
      a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, 
      which have already been linked to MS. INTERPRETATION: Here we describe the 
      metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as 
      a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug 
      targeting assays in vitro. Our findings recapitulate several disease features 
      described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic 
      rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic 
      studies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:652-669.

AB  - Early delineation of host immune responses at the moment of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (Mtb) exposure and infection is critical to identify individuals at 
      risk of progressing to active tuberculosis (TB). We performed single-cell 
      transcriptional profiling of over 500,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
      57 HIV-negative close contacts of TB cases in Brazil, including 25 individuals 
      who developed active disease within two years (progressors) and 32 matched 
      controls who remained disease-free (non-progressors). Cells were stimulated 
      separately with the MTB300 peptide pool or irradiated Mtb (gRV), enabling 
      resolution of antigen-reactive states across adaptive (CD4⁺ T-cells expressing 
      abundant cytokines including IFNG, TNF, and IL17F) and trained-innate lineages, 
      such as NK cells (producing GM-CSF, IFNG, CCL3, CCL4) and monocytes (GM-CSF, 
      IL12B, IL36G). Progressors exhibited early hyper-metabolic CD4⁺ T-cell programs 
      and proliferative NK cell signatures, whereas non-progressors preferentially 
      upregulated complement activation and CCL3/4-driven chemokine signaling in 
      monocytes. Notably, among progressors, gene expression profiles within 
      antigen-reactive CD4⁺ T-cells and monocytes predicted the timing of progression 
      to active TB. Together, these findings reveal high frequencies and functional 
      diversity of antigen-reactive cells in Mtb-exposed individuals and nominate 
      tractable immune correlates for the rational design of next-generation TB 
      vaccines.

AB  - Dengue, a widespread mosquito-borne disease, annually afflicts millions globally, 
      posing substantial mortality risks. Preceding disease defervescence, a marked and 
      transient surge in antibody-secreting cell (ASC) frequency correlates with 
      disease severity, paralleled by heightened tryptophan degradation. Investigating 
      details of this process through single-cell transcriptomics from public 
      repositories, our data pinpoint CD14+ monocytes as principal IDO1 and IDO2 
      expressors, implicating them, rather than B cells, in initiating tryptophan 
      metabolism. Interestingly, naive B cells exhibit altered gene expression 
      indicative of early impact by tryptophan deficiency before defervescence with a 
      potential impact on the B cell fate. Dengue-induced ASCs upregulated GCN2, PERK, 
      eIF2a, ATF4 genes as well as BIM and CASP-3. However, the high expression of 
      anti-apoptotic genes (FKBP8 [a CHOP-regulated gene], BCL-XL, BCL-2, MCL-1) allows 
      enhanced ASC survival. Proliferation and differentiation-related genes (eIF4EBP1, 
      RRM2, and HIF1a) were also upregulated in ASCs. These findings untangle how 
      Dengue modulates the host metabolism and B-cell responses, although further 
      research is needed to fully understand their implications on disease progression.

TI  - Immunity to viruses: learning from successful human vaccines.
PG  - 243-55
LID - 10.1111/imr.12099 [doi]
AB  - For more than a century, immunologists and vaccinologists have existed in 
      parallel universes. Immunologists have for long reveled in using 'model 
      antigens', such as chicken egg ovalbumin or nitrophenyl haptens, to study immune 
      responses in model organisms such as mice. Such studies have yielded many seminal 
      insights about the mechanisms of immune regulation, but their relevance to humans 
      has been questioned. In another universe, vaccinologists have relied on human 
      clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy, but have done little to take 
      advantage of such trials for studying the nature of immune responses to 
      vaccination. The human model provides a nexus between these two universes, and 
      recent studies have begun to use this model to study the molecular profile of 
      innate and adaptive responses to vaccination. Such 'systems vaccinology' studies 
      are beginning to provide mechanistic insights about innate and adaptive immunity 
      in humans. Here, we present an overview of such studies, with particular examples 
      from studies with the yellow fever and the seasonal influenza vaccines. 
      Vaccination with the yellow fever vaccine causes a systemic acute viral infection 
      and thus provides an attractive model to study innate and adaptive responses to a 
      primary viral challenge. Vaccination with the live attenuated influenza vaccine 
      causes a localized acute viral infection in mucosal tissues and induces a recall 
      response, since most vaccinees have had prior exposure to influenza, and thus 
      provides a unique opportunity to study innate and antigen-specific memory 
      responses in mucosal tissues and in the blood. Vaccination with the inactivated 
      influenza vaccine offers a model to study immune responses to an inactivated 
      immunogen. Studies with these and other vaccines are beginning to reunite the 
      estranged fields of immunology and vaccinology, yielding unexpected insights 
      about mechanisms of viral immunity. Vaccines that have been proven to be of 
      immense benefit in saving lives offer us a new fringe benefit: lessons in viral 
      immunology.

AB  - Cancer cells are embedded within the tissue and interact dynamically with its 
      components during cancer progression. Understanding the contribution of cellular 
      components within the tumor microenvironment is crucial for the success of 
      therapeutic applications. Here, we reveal the presence of perivascular 
      GFAP+/Plp1+ cells within the tumor microenvironment. Using in vivo inducible 
      Cre/loxP mediated systems, we demonstrated that these cells derive from 
      tissue-resident Schwann cells. Genetic ablation of endogenous Schwann cells 
      slowed down tumor growth and angiogenesis. Schwann cell-specific depletion also 
      induced a boost in the immune surveillance by increasing tumor-infiltrating 
      anti-tumor lymphocytes, while reducing immune-suppressor cells. In humans, a 
      retrospective in silico analysis of tumor biopsies revealed that increased 
      expression of Schwann cell-related genes within melanoma was associated with 
      improved survival. Collectively, our study suggests that Schwann cells regulate 
      tumor progression, indicating that manipulation of Schwann cells may provide a 
      valuable tool to improve cancer patients' outcomes.

TI  - Imbalanced IL-1B and IL-18 Expression in Sézary Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24054674 [doi]
LID - 4674
AB  - Sézary syndrome (SS) is a rare and aggressive type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 
      with an abnormal inflammatory response in affected skin. The cytokines IL-1B and 
      IL-18, as key signaling molecules in the immune system, are produced in an 
      inactive form and cleave to the active form by inflammasomes. In this study, we 
      assessed the skin, serum, peripheral mononuclear blood cell (PBMC) and lymph-node 
      samples of SS patients and control groups (healthy donors (HDs) and idiopathic 
      erythroderma (IE) nodes) to investigate the inflammatory markers IL-1B and IL-18 
      at the protein and transcript expression levels, as potential markers of 
      inflammasome activation. Our findings showed increased IL-1B and decreased IL-18 
      protein expression in the epidermis of SS patients; however, in the dermis layer, 
      we detected increased IL-18 protein expression. In the lymph nodes of SS patients 
      at advanced stages of the disease (N2/N3), we also detected an enhancement of 
      IL-18 and a downregulation of IL-1B at the protein level. Moreover, the 
      transcriptomic analysis of the SS and IE nodes confirmed the decreased expression 
      of IL1B and NLRP3, whereas the pathway analysis indicated a further 
      downregulation of IL1B-associated genes. Overall, the present findings showed 
      compartmentalized expressions of IL-1B and IL-18 and provided the first evidence 
      of their imbalance in patients with Sézary syndrome.

TI  - Systems vaccinology: its promise and challenge for HIV vaccine development.
PG  - 24-31
LID - 10.1097/COH.0b013e32834dc37b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The use of systems biology approaches to understand and 
      predict vaccine-induced immunity promises to revolutionize vaccinology. For 
      centuries vaccines were developed empirically, with very little understanding of 
      the mechanisms by which they mediate protective immunity. The so-called systems 
      vaccinology approach employs high-throughput technologies (e.g. microarrays, 
      RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics) and 
      computational modeling to describe the complex interactions between all the parts 
      of immune system, with a view to elucidating new biological rules capable of 
      predicting the behavior of the system. RECENT FINDINGS: Systems biology 
      successfully applied to yellow-fever and influenza vaccines has led to the 
      discovery of signatures that predict vaccine immunogenicity, and promises to 
      advance basic immunology research by providing novel mechanistic insights about 
      immune regulation. However a major challenge of systems vaccinology concerns the 
      analyses and interpretation of the large and noisy data sets generated by 
      high-throughput techniques. Overcoming these issues, we envision that systems 
      vaccinology will have a potential impact on vaccine development, including HIV 
      vaccines. SUMMARY: High-throughput technologies allow the investigation of 
      vaccine-induced immune responses at system and molecular levels. These are 
      currently being used to unravel new molecular insights about the immune system, 
      and are on the verge of being integrated into clinical trials to enable rational 
      vaccine design and development.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of using systems approaches to 
      identify molecular signatures that can be used to predict vaccine immunity in 
      humans. Such approaches are now being used extensively in vaccinology, and are 
      beginning to yield novel insights about the molecular networks driving vaccine 
      immunity. In this review, we present a broad review of the methodologies involved 
      in these studies, and discuss the promise and challenges involved in this 
      emerging field of "systems vaccinology."

AB  - The goal of systems biology is to access and integrate information about the 
      parts (e.g., genes, proteins, cells) of a biological system with a view to 
      computing and predicting the behavior of the system. The past decade has 
      witnessed technological revolutions in the capacity to make high throughput 
      measurements about the behavior of genes, proteins, and cells. Such technologies 
      are widely used in biological research and in medicine, such as toward prognosis 
      and therapy response prediction in cancer patients. More recently, systems 
      biology is being applied to vaccinology, with the goal of: (1) understanding the 
      mechanisms by which vaccines stimulate protective immunity, and (2) predicting 
      the immunogenicity or efficacy of vaccines. Here, we review the recent advances 
      in this area, and highlight the biological and computational challenges posed.

AB  - Thousands of biomedical scientific articles, including those describing genes 
      associated with human diseases, are published every week. Computational methods 
      such as text mining and machine learning algorithms are now able to automatically 
      detect these associations. In this study, we used a cognitive computing 
      text-mining application to construct a knowledge network comprising 3,723 genes 
      and 99 diseases. We then tracked the yearly changes on these networks to analyze 
      how our knowledge has evolved in the past 30 years. Our systems approach helped 
      to unravel the molecular bases of diseases and detect shared mechanisms between 
      clinically distinct diseases. It also revealed that multi-purpose therapeutic 
      drugs target genes that are commonly associated with several psychiatric, 
      inflammatory, or infectious disorders. By navigating this knowledge tsunami, we 
      were able to extract relevant biological information and insights about human 
      diseases.

TI  - Platelet-monocyte interaction amplifies thromboinflammation through tissue factor

AB  - Accumulating evidence into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 highlights a 
      hypercoagulability state with high risk of life-threatening thromboembolic 
      complications. However, the mechanisms of hypercoagulability and their link to 
      hyperinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate functions and 
      mechanisms of platelet activation and platelet-monocyte interactions in 
      inflammatory amplification during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a combination of 
      immunophenotyping, single-cell analysis, functional assays, and pharmacological 
      approaches to gain insights on mechanisms. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 
      exhibited increased platelet-monocyte aggregates formation. We identified a 
      subset of inflammatory monocytes presenting high CD16 and low HLA-DR expression 
      as the subset mainly interacting with platelets during severe COVID-19. 
      Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated enhanced fibrinogen receptor Mac-1 
      in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. Monocytes from patients with 
      severe COVID-19 displayed increased platelet binding and hyperresponsiveness to 
      P-selectin and fibrinogen with respect to tumor necrosis factor-α and 
      interleukin-1β secretion. Platelets were able to orchestrate monocyte responses 
      driving tissue factor (TF) expression, inflammatory activation, and inflammatory 
      cytokines secretion in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet-monocyte interactions ex 
      vivo and in SARS-CoV-2 infection model in vitro reciprocally activated monocytes 
      and platelets, inducing the heightened secretion of a wide panel of inflammatory 
      mediators. We identified platelet adhesion as a primary signaling mechanism 
      inducing mediator secretion and TF expression, whereas TF signaling played major 
      roles in amplifying inflammation by inducing proinflammatory cytokines, 
      especially tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Our data identify 
      platelet-induced TF expression and activity at the crossroad of coagulation and 
      inflammation in severe COVID-19.

AB  - The world is currently facing a serious SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic. 
      </mac_aq>This virus is a new isolate of coronavirus, and the current infection 
      crisis has surpassed the SARS and MERS epidemics</mac_aq> that occurred in 2002 
      and 2013, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 
      people, causing </mac_aq>5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 
      </mac_aq>countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly 
      demonstrates the potential threat </mac_aq>of respiratory viruses to human 
      health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive 
      </mac_aq>health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the 
      crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. 
      However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require 
      assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied. What is intriguing, 
      however, is the higher susceptibility of the elderly, especially individuals who 
      are older than 60 years of age, and have comorbidities, including hypertension, 
      diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 
      10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not 
      considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible 
      molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be 
      more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main 
      </mac_aq>points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in 
      users of chronic angiotensin 1 </mac_aq>receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) 
      antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating 
      coronaviruses. We believe that these points are pivotal for a better 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully 
      addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.

LID - 10.1111/jcmm.17938 [doi]
AB  - Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical condition characterized by a robust 
      immune inflammatory response to disseminated infection. Little is known about its 
      impact on the transcriptome of distinct human tissues. To address this, we 
      performed RNA sequencing of samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, 
      heart, lung, kidney and colon of seven individuals who succumbed to sepsis and 
      seven uninfected controls. We identified that the lungs and colon were the most 
      affected organs. While gene activation dominated, strong inhibitory signals were 
      also detected, particularly in the lungs. We found that septic shock is an 
      extremely heterogeneous disease, not only when different individuals are 
      investigated, but also when comparing different tissues of the same patient. 
      However, several pathways, such as respiratory electron transport and other 
      metabolic functions, revealed distinctive alterations, providing evidence that 
      tissue specificity is a hallmark of sepsis. Strikingly, we found evident signals 
      of accelerated ageing in our sepsis population.

AB  - Brazil currently has one of the fastest-growing severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemics in the world. Because of limited available 
      data, assessments of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on this 
      virus spread remain challenging. Using a mobility-driven transmission model, we 
      show that NPIs reduced the reproduction number from >3 to 1 to 1.6 in São Paulo 
      and Rio de Janeiro. Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a 
      geographically representative genomic dataset identified >100 international virus 
      introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76%) of the Brazilian strains 
      fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February and 11 
      March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread 
      mostly locally and within state borders. After this period, despite sharp 
      decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban 
      centers that coincided with a 25% increase in average traveled distances in 
      national flights. This study sheds new light on the epidemic transmission and 
      evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and provides evidence 
      that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under 
      control in this country.

TI  - S100A9 Drives the Chronification of Psoriasiform Inflammation by Inducing 
      IL-23/Type 3 Immunity.

AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder driven by the IL-23/type 3 
      immune response. However, molecular mechanisms sustaining the chronicity of 
      inflammation and psoriatic lesions remain elusive. Combining systematic analyses 
      of several transcriptomic datasets, we delineated gene signatures across human 
      psoriatic skin, identifying S100A9 as one of the most up-regulated genes, which 
      was confirmed in lesioned skin from patients with psoriasis and preclinical 
      psoriasiform skin inflammation models. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic 
      inhibition of S100A9 alleviated Aldara-induced skin inflammation. By single-cell 
      mapping of human psoriatic skin and bone marrow chimeric mice experiments, we 
      identified keratinocytes as the major source of S100A9. Mechanistically, S100A9 
      induced IL-23 production by dendritic cells, driving the IL-23/type 3 immunity in 
      psoriasiform skin inflammation. In addition, the cutaneous IL-23/IL-17 axis 
      induced epidermal S100A9 expression in human and experimental psoriasis. Thus, we 
      showed an autoregulatory circuit between keratinocyte-derived S100A9 and 
      IL-23/type 3 immunity during psoriasiform inflammation, identifying a crucial 
      function of S100A9 in the chronification of psoriasis.

AB  - Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) research is already a routine in every genomics or 
      transcriptomics initiatives. According to their functions, ncRNAs can be grouped 
      into several different RNA families, which can be represented by conserved 
      primary sequences, secondary structures, or covariance models (CMs). CMs are very 
      sensitive in predicting RNA families in nucleotide sequences and have been widely 
      used in characterizing the repertoire of ncRNAs in organisms from all domains of 
      life. However, the large-scale prediction and annotation of ncRNAs require 
      multiple tools along the process, imposing a great obstacle for researchers with 
      lesser computational or bioinformatics background. StructRNAfinder emerged as an 
      automated tool to avoid these bottlenecks, by performing the automatic 
      identification and complete annotation of regulatory RNA families derived 
      directly from nucleotide sequences. In this chapter, we provide a complete 
      tutorial for both stand-alone and web server versions of StructRNAfinder. This 
      will help users to install the tool and to perform predictions of RNA families in 
      any genome or transcriptome sequences dataset.

      skin inflammation.

AB  - Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinocyte 
      proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by IL-17. However, the 
      molecular mechanism through which IL-17 signaling in keratinocytes triggers skin 
      inflammation remains not fully understood. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a 
      glycolytic enzyme, has been shown to have non-metabolic functions. Here, we 
      report that PKM2 mediates IL-17A signaling in keratinocytes triggering skin 
      psoriatic inflammation. We find high expression of PKM2 in the epidermis of 
      psoriatic patients and mice undergoing psoriasis models. Specific depletion of 
      PKM2 in keratinocytes attenuates the development of experimental psoriasis by 
      reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Mechanistically, PKM2 
      forms a complex with Act1 and TRAF6 regulating NF-κB transcriptional signaling 
      downstream of the IL-17 receptor. As IL-17 also induces PKM2 expression in 
      keratinocytes, our findings reveal a sustained signaling circuit critical for the 
      psoriasis-driving effects of IL-17A, suggesting that PKM2 is a potential 
      therapeutic target for psoriasis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP (Ervebo®) vaccine is both immunogenic and 
      protective against Ebola. However, the vaccine can cause a broad range of 
      transient adverse reactions, from headache to arthritis. Identifying baseline 
      reactogenicity signatures can advance personalized vaccinology and increase our 
      understanding of the molecular factors associated with such adverse events. 
      METHODS: In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to integrate 
      prevaccination gene expression data with adverse events that occurred within 14 
      days post-vaccination. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analyzed the expression of 144 
      genes across 343 blood samples collected from participants of 4 phase I clinical 
      trial cohorts: Switzerland, USA, Gabon, and Kenya. Our machine learning approach 
      revealed 22 key genes associated with adverse events such as local reactions, 
      fatigue, headache, myalgia, fever, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and arthritis, 
      providing insights into potential biological mechanisms linked to vaccine 
      reactogenicity.

      mouse embryonic stem cells and early mammalian development.

AB  - Proteostasis, maintained by a network of molecular chaperones, plays a central 
      role in cell biology, and has emerged as a critical mechanism underlying 
      pluripotency and development. The stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is a 
      co-chaperone essential for proteostasis. STIP1 knockout causes embryonic 
      lethality in mice, but its precise function during embryogenesis remains poorly 
      understood. Here, we investigate the role of STIP1 in early development using in 
      silico and cell-based approaches. Single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals that 
      Stip1 is co-expressed with pluripotency genes in mouse embryos, suggesting a role 
      in stem cell maintenance. To test this, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells 
      (mESCs) from genetically modified mice with altered Stip1/STIP1 expression. STIP1 
      depletion in mESCs decreases the expression of pluripotency markers, reduces 
      proliferation, and induces apoptosis and genomic instability, whereas its 
      overexpression enhances pluripotency markers expression, promotes proliferation, 
      and confers protection against cellular stress. Moreover, proteins involved in 
      cell cycle progression and DNA damage response are differentially regulated in 
      mESCs, depending on STIP1 levels. Our findings highlight STIP1 as a pivotal 
      regulator of the pluripotent phenotype, early embryogenesis, and cellular 
      resilience, advancing our understanding of proteostasis in stem cell biology and 
      organismal development, with potential implications for disease modeling and 
      regenerative medicine.

TI  - COVID-19-related hyperglycemia is associated with infection of hepatocytes and 
      stimulation of gluconeogenesis.

AB  - Occurrence of hyperglycemia upon infection is associated with worse clinical 
      outcome in COVID-19 patients. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 
      directly triggers hyperglycemia. Herein, we interrogated whether and how 
      SARS-CoV-2 causes hyperglycemia by infecting hepatocytes and increasing glucose 
      production. We performed a retrospective cohort study including patients that 
      were admitted at a hospital with suspicion of COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory 
      data were collected from the chart records and daily blood glucose values were 
      analyzed to test the hypothesis on whether COVID-19 was independently associated 
      with hyperglycemia. Blood glucose was collected from a subgroup of nondiabetic 
      patients to assess pancreatic hormones. Postmortem liver biopsies were collected 
      to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its transporters in hepatocytes. In 
      human hepatocytes, we studied the mechanistic bases of SARS-CoV-2 entrance and 
      its gluconeogenic effect. SARS-CoV-2 infection was independently associated with 
      hyperglycemia, regardless of diabetic history and beta cell function. We detected 
      replicating viruses in human hepatocytes from postmortem liver biopsies and in 
      primary hepatocytes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 variants infected human 
      hepatocytes in vitro with different susceptibility. SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
      hepatocytes yields the release of new infectious viral particles, though not 
      causing cell damage. We showed that infected hepatocytes increase glucose 
      production and this is associated with induction of PEPCK activity. Furthermore, 
      our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry in hepatocytes occurs partially 
      through ACE2- and GRP78-dependent mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates 
      in hepatocytes and exerts a PEPCK-dependent gluconeogenic effect in these cells 
      that potentially is a key cause of hyperglycemia in infected patients.

AB  - The immune system responds to infection or vaccination through a dynamic and 
      complex process that involves several molecular and cellular factors. Among these 
      factors, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as significant players in 
      all areas of biology, particularly in immunology. Most of the mammalian genome is 
      transcribed in a highly regulated manner, generating a diversity of lncRNAs that 
      impact the differentiation and activation of immune cells and affect innate and 
      adaptive immunity. Here, we have reviewed the range of functions and mechanisms 
      of lncRNAs in response to infectious disease, including pathogen recognition, 
      interferon (IFN) response, and inflammation. We describe examples of lncRNAs 
      exploited by pathogenic agents during infection, which indicate that lncRNAs are 
      a fundamental part of the arms race between hosts and pathogens. We also discuss 
      lncRNAs potentially implicated in vaccine-induced immunity and present examples 
      of lncRNAs associated with the antibody response of subjects receiving Influenza 
      or Yellow Fever vaccines. Elucidating the widespread involvement of lncRNAs in 
      the immune system will improve our understanding of the factors affecting immune 
      response to different pathogenic agents, to better prevent and treat disease.

TI  - Clinical markers of post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory joint disease: A 
      Brazilian cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chikungunya-fever (CHIKF) remains a public health major issue. It is 
      clinically divided into three phases: acute, post-acute and chronic. Chronic 
      cases correspond to 25-40% individuals and, though most of them are characterized 
      by long-lasting arthralgia alone, many of them exhibit persistent or recurrent 
      inflammatory signs that define post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory joint 
      disease (pCHIKV-CIJD). We aimed to identify early clinical markers of evolution 
      to pCHIKV-CIJD during acute and post-acute phases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We studied a prospective cohort of CHIKF-confirmed volunteers with 
      longitudinal clinical data collection from symptoms onset up to 90 days, 
      including a 21-day visit (D21). Of 169 patients with CHIKF, 86 (50.9%) completed 
      the follow-up, from whom 39 met clinical criteria for pCHIKV-CIJD (45.3%). The 
      relative risk of chronification was higher in women compared to men (RR = 1.52; 
      95% CI = 1.15-1.99; FDR = 0.03). None of the symptoms or signs presented at D0 
      behaved as an early predictor of pCHIKV-CIJD, while being symptomatic at D21 was 
      a risk factor for chronification (RR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.09-1.55; FDR = 0.03). 
      Significance was also observed for joint pain (RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.12-1.61; FDR 
      = 0.02), reported edema (RR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.44-9.06; FDR = 0.03), reported 
      hand and/or feet small joints edema (RR = 4.22; 95% CI = 1.51-11.78; FDR = 0.02), 
      and peri-articular edema observed during physical examination (RR = 2.89; 95% CI 
      = 1.58-5.28; FDR = 0.002). Furthermore, patients with no findings in physical 
      examination at D21 were at lower risk of chronic evolution (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 
      0.24-0.70, FDR = 0.01). Twenty-nine pCHIKV-CIJD patients had abnormal articular 
      ultrasonography (90.6% of the examined). The most common findings were synovitis 
      (65.5%) and joint effusion (58.6%). CONCLUSION: This cohort has provided 
      important insights into the prognostic evaluation of CHIKF. Symptomatic sub-acute 
      disease is a relevant predictor of evolution to chronic arthritis with synovitis, 
      drawing attention to joint pain, edema, multiple articular involvement including 
      small hand and feet joints as risk factors for chronification beyond three 
      months, especially in women. Future studies are needed to accomplish the 
      identification of accurate and early biomarkers of poor clinical prognosis, which 
      would allow better understanding of the disease's evolution and improve patients' 
      management, modifying CHIKF burden on global public health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An adult wild-type C57BL/6J mouse model of chikungunya virus 
      (CHIKV) infection and disease has been extensively used to study the alphaviral 
      arthritic immunopathology and to evaluate new interventions. How well mouse 
      models recapitulate the gene expression profiles seen in humans remains 
      controversial. METHODS: Herein we perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis 
      using RNA-Seq datasets from the C57BL/6J CHIKV mouse model with datasets obtained 
      from adults and children acutely infected with CHIKV. RESULTS: Despite sampling 
      quite different tissues, peripheral blood from humans and feet from mice, gene 
      expression profiles were quite similar, with an overlap of up to ≈50% for 
      up-regulated single copy orthologue differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, 
      high levels of significant concordance between mouse and human were seen for 
      immune pathways and signatures, which were dominated by interferons, T cells and 
      monocyte/macrophages. Importantly, predicted responses to a series of 
      anti-inflammatory drug and biologic treatments also showed cogent similarities 
      between species. DISCUSSION: Comparative transcriptomics and subsequent pathway 
      analysis provides a detailed picture of how a given model recapitulates human 
      gene expression. Using this method, we show that the C57BL/6J CHIKV mouse model 
      provides a reliable and representative system in which to study CHIKV 
      immunopathology and evaluate new treatments.

AB  - Cytotoxic agents synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve outcomes 
      for patients with several cancer types. Nonetheless, a parallel increase in the 
      incidence of dose-limiting side effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, is often 
      observed. Here, we investigated the role of the programmed cell death-1 
      (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis in the modulation of 
      paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. We found that human and mouse neural 
      tissues, including the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), expressed basal levels of PD-1 
      and PD-L1. During the development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, an increase 
      in PD-L1 expression was observed in macrophages from the DRG. This effect 
      depended on Toll-like receptor 4 activation by paclitaxel. Furthermore, PD-L1 
      inhibited pain behavior triggered by paclitaxel or formalin in mice, suggesting 
      that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling attenuates peripheral neuropathy development. 
      Consistent with this, we observed that the combined use of anti-PD-L1 plus 
      paclitaxel increased mechanical allodynia and chronic neuropathy development 
      induced by single agents. This effect was associated with higher expression of 
      inflammatory markers (Tnf, Il6, and Cx3cr1) in peripheral nervous tissue. 
      Together, these results suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enhance 
      paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain by suppressing PD-1/PD-L1 antinociceptive 
      signaling.

TI  - Efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected dying cells impairs macrophage 
      anti-inflammatory functions and clearance of apoptotic cells.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.74443 [doi]
LID - e74443
AB  - COVID-19 is a disease of dysfunctional immune responses, but the mechanisms 
      triggering immunopathogenesis are not established. The functional plasticity of 
      macrophages allows this cell type to promote pathogen elimination and 
      inflammation or suppress inflammation and promote tissue remodeling and injury 
      repair. During an infection, the clearance of dead and dying cells, a process 
      named efferocytosis, can modulate the interplay between these contrasting 
      functions. Here, we show that engulfment of SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells 
      exacerbates inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits the expression of 
      efferocytic receptors, and impairs continual efferocytosis by macrophages. We 
      also provide evidence supporting that lung monocytes and macrophages from severe 
      COVID-19 patients have compromised efferocytic capacity. Our findings reveal that 
      dysfunctional efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell corpses suppresses 
      macrophage anti-inflammation and efficient tissue repair programs and provides 
      mechanistic insights for the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
      and accumulation of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity is associated with low grade systemic inflammation and 
      insulin resistance. Although metabolic and immunological changes may contribute 
      to the increased risk for COVID-19 mortality in obese, little is known about the 
      impact of obesity in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed 
      gene expression profiles of autopsy lungs of a cohort of 14 COVID-19 patients and 
      4 control individuals. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their 
      comorbidities: hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We then 
      identified the molecular alterations associated with these comorbidities in 
      COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Patients with only hypertension showed higher levels 
      of inflammatory genes and B-cell related genes when compared to those with T2D 
      and obesity. However, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL22, and CD274 (a ligand that 
      binds to receptor PD1) were higher in COVID-19 patients with T2D and obesity. 
      Several metabolic- and immune-associated genes such as G6PD, LCK and IL10 were 
      significantly induced in the lungs of the obese group. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may exacerbate the immune response 
      and chronic condition in obese COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Several perturbations in the number of peripheral blood leukocytes, such as 
      neutrophilia and lymphopenia associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      severity, point to systemic molecular cell cycle alterations during severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the landscape 
      of cell cycle alterations in COVID-19 remains primarily unexplored. Here, we 
      performed an integrative systems immunology analysis of publicly available 
      proteome and transcriptome data to characterize global changes in the cell cycle 
      signature of COVID-19 patients. We found significantly enriched cell 
      cycle-associated gene co-expression modules and an interconnected network of cell 
      cycle-associated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) by 
      integrating the molecular data of 1469 individuals (981 SARS-CoV-2 infected 
      patients and 488 controls [either healthy controls or individuals with other 
      respiratory illnesses]). Among these DEPs and DEGs are several cyclins, cell 
      division cycles, cyclin-dependent kinases, and mini-chromosome 
      maintenance proteins. COVID-19 patients partially shared the expression pattern 
      of some cell cycle-associated genes with other respiratory illnesses but 
      exhibited some specific differential features. Notably, the cell cycle signature 
      predominated in the patients' blood leukocytes (B, T, and natural killer cells) 
      and was associated with COVID-19 severity and disease trajectories. These results 
      provide a unique global understanding of distinct alterations in cell 
      cycle-associated molecules in COVID-19 patients, suggesting new putative pathways 
      for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Considering the likely need for the development of novel effective 
      vaccines adapted to emerging relevant CoV-2 variants, the increasing knowledge of 
      epitope recognition profile among convalescents and afterwards vaccinated with 
      identification of immunodominant regions may provide important information. 
      METHODS: We used an RBD peptide microarray to identify IgG and IgA binding 
      regions in serum of 71 COVID-19 convalescents and 18 vaccinated individuals. 
      RESULTS: We found a set of immunodominant RBD antibody epitopes, each recognized 
      by more than 30% of the tested cohort, that differ among the two different groups 
      and are within conserved regions among betacoronavirus. Of those, only one 
      peptide, P44 (S415-429), recognized by 68% of convalescents, presented IgG and 
      IgA antibody reactivity that positively correlated with nAb titers, suggesting 
      that this is a relevant RBD region and a potential target of IgG/IgA neutralizing 
      activity. DISCUSSION: This peptide is localized within the area of contact with 
      ACE-2 and harbors the mutation hotspot site K417 present in gamma (K417T), beta 
      (K417N), and omicron (K417N) variants of concern. The epitope profile of 
      vaccinated individuals differed from convalescents, with a more diverse 
      repertoire of immunodominant peptides, recognized by more than 30% of the cohort. 
      Noteworthy, immunodominant regions of recognition by vaccinated coincide with 
      mutation sites at Omicron BA.1, an important variant emerging after massive 
      vaccination. Together, our data show that immune pressure induced by dominant 
      antibody responses may favor hotspot mutation sites and the selection of variants 
      capable of evading humoral response.

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation contributes to high-fat diet-induced 
      vascular dysfunction.
PG  - 2938-2952
LID - 10.1111/bph.15789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Metabolic and vascular dysfunction are common features of 
      obesity. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates lipid metabolism and vascular 
      homeostasis, but whether vascular AhR are activated in obesity or have a 
      protective and/or harmful effects on vascular function in obesity are unknown. 
      Our study addresses whether AhR activation contributes to obesity-associated 
      vascular dysfunction and the mechanisms involved in these AhR effects. 
      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male AhR KO (Ahr(-/-) ) and WT mice were fed either 
      control or a HF (high-fat) diet for 10 weeks. Metabolic and inflammatory 
      parameters were measured in serum and adipose tissue. Vascular reactivity 
      (isometric force) was evaluated using a myography. Endothelial NOS (eNOS) and AhR 
      protein expression was determined by western blot, Cyp1A1 and Nos3 gene 
      expression by RT-PCR and.NO production was quantified by DAF fluorescence. KEY 
      RESULTS: HF diet increased total serum HDL and LDL, as well as vascular AhR 
      protein expression and proinflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue. HF diet 
      decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation. AhR deletion protected mice from HF 
      diet-induced dyslipidaemia, weight gain and inflammatory processes. HF 
      diet-induced endothelial dysfunction was attenuated in Ahr(-/-) mice. Vessels 
      from Ahr(-/-) mice exhibited a greater NO reserve. In cultured endothelial cells, 
      lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) a major component of LDL and oxidized LDL [oxLDL]) 
      reduced Nos3 gene expression and NO production. Antagonism of the AhR inhibited 
      LPC effects on endothelial cells and induced decreased endothelium-dependent 
      vasodilation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: AhR deletion attenuates HF 
      diet-induced dyslipidaemia and vascular dysfunction by improving eNOS/NO 
      signalling. Targeting AhRs may prevent obesity-associated vascular dysfunction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To leverage passively collected retrospective smartphone location data 
      to accurately identify malaria transmission hotspots through the development of a 
      novel tool, the Sickness Positioning System. METHODS: We collected anonymized 
      location history data from over 200 malaria-infected individuals using Google 
      Takeout. Sickness Positioning System applies density-based clustering techniques 
      to this passively collected data to identify areas of elevated infection risk. 
      The identified hotspots were subsequently validated through field investigations. 
      RESULTS: Sickness Positioning System successfully pinpointed multiple areas of 
      increased malaria transmission risk. Field validation confirmed two previously 
      unrecognized mosquito breeding sites as active sources of transmission. When 
      compared to Brazil's federal surveillance system - which updates data annually - 
      Sickness Positioning System provided a more precise and timely spatial assessment 
      of malaria spread. CONCLUSION: Sickness Positioning System demonstrates a 
      cost-effective, objective, and timely method for identifying malaria transmission 
      hotspots. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance disease 
      surveillance and facilitate more targeted public health interventions.

AB  - Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts 
      and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its 
      efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal 
      responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of 
      immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated 
      shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, 
      plasmablasts, and CD4(+) T cells yet limited CD8(+) T cell and antiviral 
      responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, 
      such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and 
      cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine 
      immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and 
      sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol 
      regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and 
      T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human 
      immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms 
      controlling immunity to vaccination.

TI  - CEMiTool: a Bioconductor package for performing comprehensive modular 
      co-expression analyses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The analysis of modular gene co-expression networks is a 
      well-established method commonly used for discovering the systems-level 
      functionality of genes. In addition, these studies provide a basis for the 
      discovery of clinically relevant molecular pathways underlying different diseases 
      and conditions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use 
      Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery and the analysis 
      of co-expression modules. Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that 
      CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a 
      user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool 
      evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific 
      pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates 
      transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs 
      on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome 
      datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, 
      revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. CONCLUSION: The 
      CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically 
      implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the 
      discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve 
      publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.

AB  - Comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) increases tuberculosis (TB) risk and adverse 
      outcomes but the pathological interactions between DM and TB remain incompletely 
      understood. We performed an integrative analysis of whole blood gene expression 
      and plasma analytes, comparing South Indian TB patients with and without DM to 
      diabetic and non-diabetic controls without TB. Luminex assay of plasma cytokines 
      and growth factors delineated a distinct biosignature in comorbid TBDM in this 
      cohort. Transcriptional profiling revealed elements in common with published TB 
      signatures from cohorts that excluded DM. Neutrophil count correlated with the 
      molecular degree of perturbation, especially in TBDM patients. Body mass index 
      and HDL cholesterol were negatively correlated with molecular degree of 
      perturbation. Diabetic complication pathways including several pathways linked to 
      epigenetic reprogramming were activated in TBDM above levels observed with DM 
      alone. Our data provide a rationale for trials of host-directed therapies in 
      TBDM, targeting neutrophilic inflammation and diabetic complication pathways to 
      address the greater morbidity and mortality associated with this increasingly 
      prevalent dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases.

TI  - Uptake of Plasmodium chabaudi hemozoin drives Kupffer cell death and fuels 
      superinfections.
PG  - 19805

AB  - Kupffer cells (KCs) are self-maintained tissue-resident macrophages that line 
      liver sinusoids and play an important role on host defense. It has been 
      demonstrated that upon infection or intense liver inflammation, KCs might be 
      severely depleted and replaced by immature monocytic cells; however, the 
      mechanisms of cell death and the alterations on liver immunity against infections 
      deserves further investigation. We explored the impact of acute Plasmodium 
      infection on KC biology and on the hepatic immune response against secondary 
      infections. Similar to patients, infection with Plasmodium chabaudi induced acute 
      liver damage as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) elevation. This was associated with accumulation of 
      hemozoin, increased of proinflammatory response and impaired bacterial and viral 
      clearance, which led to pathogen spread to other organs. In line with this, mice 
      infected with Plasmodium had enhanced mortality during secondary infections, 
      which was associated with increased production of mitochondrial superoxide, lipid 
      peroxidation and increased free iron within KCs-hallmarks of cell death by 
      ferroptosis. Therefore, we revealed that accumulation of iron with KCs, triggered 
      by uptake of circulating hemozoin, is a novel mechanism of macrophage depletion 
      and liver inflammation during malaria, providing novel insights on host 
      susceptibility to secondary infections. Malaria can cause severe liver damage, 
      along with depletion of liver macrophages, which can predispose individuals to 
      secondary infections and enhance the chances of death.

TI  - The global evolution and impact of systems biology and artificial intelligence in 
      stem cell research and therapeutics development: a scoping review.
PG  - 929-944
LID - 10.1093/stmcls/sxae054 [doi]
AB  - Advanced bioinformatics analysis, such as systems biology (SysBio) and artificial 
      intelligence (AI) approaches, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning 
      (DL), is increasingly present in stem cell (SC) research. An approximate timeline 
      on these developments and their global impact is still lacking. We conducted a 
      scoping review on the contribution of SysBio and AI analysis to SC research and 
      therapy development based on literature published in PubMed between 2000 and 
      2024. We identified an 8 to 10-fold increase in research output related to all 3 
      search terms between 2000 and 2021, with a 10-fold increase in AI-related 
      production since 2010. Use of SysBio and AI still predominates in preclinical 
      basic research with increasing use in clinically oriented translational medicine 
      since 2010. SysBio- and AI-related research was found all over the globe, with 
      SysBio output led by the (US, n = 1487), (UK, n = 1094), Germany (n = 355), The 
      Netherlands (n = 339), Russia (n = 215), and France (n = 149), while for 
      AI-related research the US (n = 853) and UK (n = 258) take a strong lead, 
      followed by Switzerland (n = 69), The Netherlands (n = 37), and Germany (n = 19). 
      The US and UK are most active in SCs publications related to AI/ML and AI/DL. The 
      prominent use of SysBio in ESC research was recently overtaken by prominent use 
      of AI in iPSC and MSC research. This study reveals the global evolution and 
      growing intersection among AI, SysBio, and SC research over the past 2 decades, 
      with substantial growth in all 3 fields and exponential increases in AI-related 
      research in the past decade.

TI  - Cutting Edge: Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 Subunit Cbx4 Positively Regulates 
      Effector Responses in CD8 T Cells.
PG  - 721-726
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2200757 [doi]
AB  - CTL differentiation is controlled by the crosstalk of various transcription 
      factors and epigenetic modulators. Uncovering this process is fundamental to 
      improving immunotherapy and designing novel therapeutic approaches. In this 
      study, we show that polycomb repressive complex 1 subunit chromobox (Cbx)4 favors 
      effector CTL differentiation in a murine model. Cbx4 deficiency in CTLs induced a 
      transcriptional signature of memory cells and increased the memory CTL population 
      during acute viral infection. It has previously been shown that besides binding 
      to H3K27me3 through its chromodomain, Cbx4 functions as a small ubiquitin-like 
      modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase in a SUMO-interacting motifs (SIM)-dependent way. 
      Overexpression of Cbx4 mutants in distinct domains showed that this protein 
      regulates CTL differentiation primarily in an SIM-dependent way and partially 
      through its chromodomain. Our data suggest a novel role of a polycomb group 
      protein Cbx4 controlling CTL differentiation and indicated SUMOylation as a key 
      molecular mechanism connected to chromatin modification in this process.

      virus vector expressing the glycoprotein G of Zaire Ebolavirus, is the first 
      vaccine approved for prevention of EVD. Both innate and adaptive responses are 
      deemed to be involved in vaccine-induced protection, yet the mechanisms are not 
      fully elucidated. A global transcriptomic approach was used to profile the blood 
      host-response in 51 healthy volunteers enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial. 
      Signatures of the host responses were investigated assessing the enrichment in 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of specific "blood transcription modules" 
      (BTM). Comparison of gene-expression levels showed that vaccination produces a 
      peak of 5469 DEGs at day one, representing 38.6% of the expressed genes. Out of 
      346 BTMs, 144 were significantly affected by vaccination. Innate immunity 
      pathways were induced from day 1 to day 14. At days 2 and 3, neutrophil modules 
      were downregulated and complement-related modules upregulated. T-cell and 
      cell-cycle associated modules were upregulated at days 7 and 14, while at day 28, 
      no modules remained activated. At day 14, a direct correlation was observed 
      between ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific antibody titres and activation of seven BTMs, 
      including two related to B-cell activation and B cell receptor signalling. 
      Transcriptomic analysis identified an rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP-induced signature and 
      demonstrated a direct correlation of blood transcriptomic changes with ZEBOV 
      glycoprotein-specific antibody titres.

TI  - An Experimental DUAL Model of Advanced Liver Damage.
PG  - 1051-1068

AB  - Individuals exhibiting an intermediate alcohol drinking pattern in conjunction 
      with signs of metabolic risk present clinical features of both alcohol-associated 
      and metabolic-associated fatty liver diseases. However, such combination remains 
      an unexplored area of great interest, given the increasing number of patients 
      affected. In the present study, we aimed to develop a preclinical DUAL 
      (alcohol-associated liver disease plus metabolic-associated fatty liver disease) 
      model in mice. C57BL/6 mice received 10% vol/vol alcohol in sweetened drinking 
      water in combination with a Western diet for 10, 23, and 52 weeks (DUAL model). 
      Animals fed with DUAL diet elicited a significant increase in body mass index 
      accompanied by a pronounced hypertrophy of adipocytes, hypercholesterolemia, and 
      hyperglycemia. Significant liver damage was characterized by elevated plasma 
      alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, extensive 
      hepatomegaly, hepatocyte enlargement, ballooning, steatosis, hepatic cell death, 
      and compensatory proliferation. Notably, DUAL animals developed lobular 
      inflammation and advanced hepatic fibrosis. Sequentially, bridging cirrhotic 
      changes were frequently observed after 12 months. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis 
      indicated that dysregulated molecular pathways in DUAL mice were similar to those 
      of patients with steatohepatitis. Conclusion: Our DUAL model is characterized by 
      obesity, glucose intolerance, liver damage, prominent steatohepatitis and 
      fibrosis, as well as inflammation and fibrosis in white adipose tissue. 
      Altogether, the DUAL model mimics all histological, metabolic, and transcriptomic 
      gene signatures of human advanced steatohepatitis, and therefore serves as a 
      preclinical tool for the development of therapeutic targets.

TI  - Noninvasive prenatal paternity determination using microhaplotypes: a pilot 
      study.
PG  - 157
LID - 10.1186/s12920-020-00806-w [doi]
LID - 157
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of noninvasive techniques to determine paternity prenatally 
      is increasing because it reduces the risks associated with invasive procedures. 
      Current methods, based on SNPs, use the analysis of at least 148 markers, on 
      average. METHODS: To reduce the number of regions, we used microhaplotypes, which 
      are chromosomal segments smaller than 200 bp containing two or more SNPs. Our 
      method employs massively parallel sequencing and analysis of microhaplotypes as 
      genetic markers. We tested 20 microhaplotypes and ascertained that 19 obey 
      Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and are independent, and data from the 1000 Genomes 
      Project were used for population frequency and simulations. RESULTS: We performed 
      simulations of true and false paternity, using the 1000 Genomes Project data, to 
      confirm if the microhaplotypes could be used as genetic markers. We observed that 
      at least 13 microhaplotypes should be used to decrease the chances of false 
      positives. Then, we applied the method in 31 trios, and it was able to correctly 
      assign the fatherhood in cases where the alleged father was the real father, 
      excluding the inconclusive results. We also cross evaluated the mother-plasma 
      duos with the alleged fathers for false inclusions within our data, and we 
      observed that the use of at least 15 microhaplotypes in real data also decreases 
      the false inclusions. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we demonstrated that 
      microhaplotypes can be used to determine prenatal paternity by using only 15 
      regions and with admixtures of DNA.

LID - 847
AB  - Severe COVID-19 patients present a clinical and laboratory overlap with other 
      hyperinflammatory conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). 
      However, the underlying mechanisms of these conditions remain to be explored. 
      Here, we investigated the transcriptome of 1596 individuals, including patients 
      with COVID-19 in comparison to healthy controls, other acute inflammatory states 
      (HLH, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C], Kawasaki disease 
      [KD]), and different respiratory infections (seasonal coronavirus, influenza, 
      bacterial pneumonia). We observed that COVID-19 and HLH share immunological 
      pathways (cytokine/chemokine signaling and neutrophil-mediated immune responses), 
      including gene signatures that stratify COVID-19 patients admitted to the 
      intensive care unit (ICU) and COVID-19_nonICU patients. Of note, among the common 
      differentially expressed genes (DEG), there is a cluster of neutrophil-associated 
      genes that reflects a generalized hyperinflammatory state since it is also 
      dysregulated in patients with KD and bacterial pneumonia. These genes are 
      dysregulated at the protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an 
      interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins that point 
      to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care 
      unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated 
      across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature 
      neutrophils. Artificial intelligence modeling confirmed the strong association of 
      these genes with COVID-19 severity. Thus, our work indicates putative therapeutic 
      pathways for intervention.

AB  - The vectored Ebola vaccine rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP elicits protection against Ebola Virus 
      Disease (EVD). In a study of forty-eight healthy adult volunteers who received 
      either the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo, we profiled intracellular 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) from whole blood cells (WB) and circulating miRNAs from 
      serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) at baseline and longitudinally 
      following vaccination. Further, we identified early miRNA signatures associated 
      with ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at baseline and up to one year 
      post-vaccination, and pinpointed target mRNA transcripts and pathways correlated 
      to miRNAs whose expression was altered after vaccination by using systems biology 
      approaches. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) and miRNA 
      signatures predicted high or low IgG ZEBOV-specific antibody levels with high 
      classification performance. The top miRNA discriminators were WB-miR-6810, 
      EV-miR-7151-3p, and EV-miR-4426. An eight-miRNA antibody predictive signature was 
      associated with immune-related target mRNAs and pathways. These findings provide 
      valuable insights into early blood biomarkers associated with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP 
      vaccine-induced IgG antibody responses.

TI  - Systems analysis of subjects acutely infected with the Chikungunya virus.
PG  - e1007880

LID - e1007880
AB  - The largest ever recorded epidemic of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) broke out in 
      2004 and affected four continents. Acute symptomatic infections are typically 
      associated with the onset of fever and often debilitating 
      polyarthralgia/polyarthritis. In this study, a systems biology approach was 
      adopted to analyze the blood transcriptomes of adults acutely infected with the 
      CHIKV. Gene signatures that were associated with viral RNA levels and the onset 
      of symptoms were identified. Among these genes, the putative role of the 
      Eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF) family genes and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing 
      catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC3A) in the CHIKV replication process were 
      displayed. We further compared these signatures with signatures induced by the 
      Dengue virus infection and rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, we demonstrated that 
      the CHIKV in vitro infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced 
      IL-1 beta production in a mechanism that is significantly dependent on the 
      inflammasome NLRP3 activation. The observations provided valuable insights into 
      virus-host interactions during the acute phase and can be instrumental in the 
      investigation of new and effective therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Long-term immunological protection relies on the differentiation and maintenance 
      of memory lymphocytes. Since the knowledge of memory generation has been centered 
      on in vivo models of infection, there are obstacles to deep molecular analysis of 
      differentiating subsets. Here we defined a novel in vitro CD8 T cell activation 
      and culture regimen using low TCR engagement and cytokines to generate 
      differentiated cells consistent with central memory-like cells, as shown by 
      surface phenotype, gene expression profile and lack of cytotoxic function after 
      challenge. Our results showed an effector signature expressed by in vitro memory 
      precursors and their plasticity under specific conditions. Moreover, memory CD8 T 
      cells conferred long-term protection against bacterial infection and slowed in 
      vivo tumor growth more efficiently than effector cells. This model may allow 
      further understanding of CD8 T cell memory molecular differentiation subsets and 
      be suited for generating cells to be used for immunotherapy.

AB  - Breastfeeding protects against mucosal infections in infants. The underlying 
      mechanisms through which immunity develops in human milk following maternal 
      infection with mucosal pathogens are not well understood. We simulated nasal 
      mucosal influenza infection through live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV) 
      and compared immune responses in milk to inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV). 
      Transcriptomic analysis was performed on RNA extracted from human milk cells to 
      evaluate differentially expressed genes and pathways on days 1 and 7 
      post-vaccination. Both LAIV and IIV vaccines induced influenza-specific IgA that 
      persisted for at least 6 months. Regulation of type I interferon production, 
      toll-like receptor, and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways were 
      highly upregulated in milk on day 1 following LAIV but not IIV at any time point. 
      Upregulation of innate immunity in human milk may provide timely protection 
      against mucosal infections until antigen-specific immunity develops in the human 
      milk-fed infant.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed more than 3.7 million victims 
      and it will cause more deaths in the coming months. Tools that track the number 
      and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and help in making policy 
      decisions for controlling the outbreak. However, the current surveillance 
      web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive and 
      require specific computational knowledge. We developed a user-friendly web tool, 
      named OUTBREAK, that facilitates epidemic surveillance by showing in an animated 
      graph the timeline and geolocations of cases of an outbreak. It permits even 
      non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in 
      real-time. We applied our tool to visualize the SARS 2003, MERS, and COVID19 
      epidemics, and provided them as examples on the website. Through the zoom 
      feature, it is also possible to visualize cases at city and even neighborhood 
      levels. We made the tool freely available at https://outbreak.sysbio.tools/ . 
      OUTBREAK has the potential to guide and help health authorities to intervene and 
      minimize the effects of outbreaks.

AB  - The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severely affects mainly individuals with 
      pre-existing comorbidities. Here our aim was to correlate the mTOR 
      (mammalian/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) and autophagy pathways with the 
      disease severity. Through western blotting and RNA analysis, we found increased 
      mTOR signaling and suppression of genes related to autophagy, lysosome, and 
      vesicle fusion in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as in 
      transcriptomic data mining of bronchoalveolar epithelial cells from severe 
      COVID-19 patients. Immunofluorescence co-localization assays also indicated that 
      SARS-CoV-2 colocalizes within autophagosomes but not with a lysosomal marker. Our 
      findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can benefit from compromised autophagic flux 
      and inhibited exocytosis in individuals with chronic hyperactivation of mTOR 
      signaling.

AB  - Severe COVID-19 is associated with hyperinflammation and weak T cell responses 
      against SARS-CoV-2. However, the links between those processes remain partially 
      characterized. Moreover, whether and how therapeutically manipulating T cells may 
      benefit patients are unknown. Our genetic and pharmacological evidence 
      demonstrates that the ion channel TMEM176B inhibited inflammasome activation 
      triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related murine β-coronavirus. 
      Tmem176b(-/-) mice infected with murine β-coronavirus developed 
      inflammasome-dependent T cell dysfunction and critical disease, which was 
      controlled by modulating dysfunctional T cells with PD-1 blockers. In critical 
      COVID-19, inflammasome activation correlated with dysfunctional T cells and low 
      monocytic TMEM176B expression, whereas PD-L1 blockade rescued T cell 
      functionality. Here, we mechanistically link T cell dysfunction and inflammation, 
      supporting a cancer immunotherapy to reinforce T cell immunity in critical 
      β-coronavirus disease.

AB  - It is well established that infection with Leishmania alters the host cell's 
      transcriptome. Since mammalian cells have multiple mechanisms to control gene 
      expression, different molecules, such as noncoding RNAs, can be involved in this 
      process. MicroRNAs have been extensively studied upon Leishmania infection, but 
      whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also altered in macrophages is still 
      unexplored. We performed RNA-seq from THP-1-derived macrophages infected with 
      Leishmania amazonensis (La), L. braziliensis (Lb), and L. infantum (Li), 
      investigating a previously unappreciated fraction of macrophage transcriptome. We 
      found that more than 24% of the total annotated transcripts and 30% of 
      differentially expressed (DE) RNAs in Leishmania-infected macrophage correspond 
      to lncRNAs. LncRNAs and protein coding RNAs with altered expression are similar 
      among macrophages infected with the Leishmania species. Still, some 
      species-specific alterations could occur due to distinct pathophysiology in which 
      Li infection led to a more significant number of exclusively DE RNAs. The most 
      represented classes among DE lncRNAs were intergenic and antisense lncRNAs. We 
      also found enrichment for immune response-related pathways in the DE protein 
      coding RNAs, as well as putative targets of the lncRNAs. We performed a 
      coexpression analysis to explore potential cis regulation of coding and antisense 
      noncoding transcripts. We identified that antisense lncRNAs are similarly 
      regulated as its neighbor protein coding genes, such as the BAALC/BAALC-AS1, 
      BAALC/BAALC-AS2, HIF1A/HIF1A-AS1, HIF1A/HIF1A-AS3 and IRF1/IRF1-AS1 pairs, which 
      can occur as a species-specific modulation. These findings are a novelty in the 
      field because, to date, no study has focused on analyzing lncRNAs in 
      Leishmania-infected macrophage. Our results suggest that lncRNAs may account for 
      a novel mechanism by which Leishmania can control macrophage function. Further 
      research must validate putative lncRNA targets and provide additional prospects 
      in lncRNA function during Leishmania infection.

AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an important enzyme in the front-line protection against 
      microorganisms. In peripheral blood, it is accepted that MPO is only produced by 
      myeloid-lineage cells. Thus, MPO presence is unexpected in lymphocytes. We showed 
      recently that B1-lymphocytes from mice have MPO. Here, we showed that subsets of 
      human peripheral B, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes express MPO. The content of 
      MPO in lymphocytes was very low compared to neutrophils/monocytes with a 
      preferential distribution in the nucleus and perinuclear region. Also, we 
      performed a MPO mRNA expression analysis from human blood cells derived from 
      microarray raw data publicly available, showing that MPO is modulated in 
      infectious disease. MPO was increased in CD4(+) T lymphocytes from HIV chronic 
      infection and in CD8(+) T lymphocytes from HCV-positive patients. Our study 
      points out MPO as a multifunctional protein due to its subcellular localization 
      and expression modulation in lymphocytes indicating alternative unknown functions 
      for MPO in lymphocytes.

TI  - CCR2 deficiency promotes exacerbated chronic erosive neutrophil-dominated 
      chikungunya virus arthritis.
PG  - 6862-72
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03364-13 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of a globally distributed group of 
      arthritogenic alphaviruses that cause weeks to months of debilitating 
      polyarthritis/arthralgia, which is often poorly managed with current treatments. 
      Arthritic disease is usually characterized by high levels of the chemokine CCL2 
      and a prodigious monocyte/macrophage infiltrate. Several inhibitors of CCL2 and 
      its receptor CCR2 are in development and may find application for treatment of 
      certain inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune and viral arthritides. Here 
      we used CCR2(-/-) mice to determine the effect of CCR2 deficiency on CHIKV 
      infection and arthritis. Although there were no significant changes in viral load 
      or RNA persistence and only marginal changes in antiviral immunity, arthritic 
      disease was substantially increased and prolonged in CCR2(-/-) mice compared to 
      wild-type mice. The monocyte/macrophage infiltrate was replaced in CCR2(-/-) mice 
      by a severe neutrophil (followed by an eosinophil) infiltrate and was associated 
      with changes in the expression levels of multiple inflammatory mediators 
      (including CXCL1, CXCL2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], 
      interleukin-1β [IL-1β], and IL-10). The loss of anti-inflammatory macrophages and 
      their activities (e.g., efferocytosis) was also implicated in exacerbated 
      inflammation. Clear evidence of cartilage damage was also seen in CHIKV-infected 
      CCR2(-/-) mice, a feature not normally associated with alphaviral arthritides. 
      Although recruitment of CCR2(+) monocytes/macrophages can contribute to 
      inflammation, it also appears to be critical for preventing excessive pathology 
      and resolving inflammation following alphavirus infection. Caution might thus be 
      warranted when considering therapeutic targeting of CCR2/CCL2 for the treatment 
      of alphaviral arthritides. IMPORTANCE: Here we describe the first analysis of 
      viral arthritis in mice deficient for the chemokine receptor CCR2. CCR2 is 
      thought to be central to the monocyte/macrophage-dominated inflammatory arthritic 
      infiltrates seen after infection with arthritogenic alphaviruses such as 
      chikungunya virus. Surprisingly, the viral arthritis caused by chikungunya virus 
      in CCR2-deficient mice was more severe, prolonged, and erosive and was neutrophil 
      dominated, with viral replication and persistence not being significantly 
      affected. Monocytes/macrophages recruited by CCL2 thus also appear to be 
      important for both preventing even worse pathology mediated by neutrophils and 
      promoting resolution of inflammation. Caution might thus be warranted when 
      considering the use of therapeutic agents that target CCR2/CCL2 or inflammatory 
      monocytes/macrophages for the treatment of alphaviral (and perhaps other viral) 
      arthritides. Individuals with diminished CCR2 responses (due to drug treatment or 
      other reasons) may also be at risk of exacerbated arthritic disease following 
      alphaviral infection.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to a group of mosquito-borne alphaviruses 
      associated with acute and chronic arthropathy, with peripheral and limb joints 
      most commonly affected. Using a mouse model of CHIKV infection and arthritic 
      disease, we show that CHIKV replication and the ensuing foot arthropathy were 
      dramatically reduced when mice were housed at 30°C, rather than the conventional 
      22°C. The effect was not associated with a detectable fever, but was dependent on 
      type I interferon responses. Bioinformatics analyses of RNA-Seq data after 
      injection of poly(I:C)/jetPEI suggested the unfolded protein response and certain 
      type I interferon responses are promoted when feet are slightly warmer. The 
      ambient temperature thus appears able profoundly to effect anti-viral activity in 
      the periphery, with clear consequences for alphaviral replication and the ensuing 
      arthropathy. These observations may provide an explanation for why alphaviral 
      arthropathies are largely restricted to joints of the limbs and the extremities.

      them 3 days later with either tetravalent-inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or 
      live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Vaccine-induced immune responses were 
      assessed in nose, blood, and lung. Nasal pneumococcal colonization had no impact 
      upon TIV-induced antibody responses to influenza, which manifested in all 
      compartments. However, experimentally induced pneumococcal colonization dampened 
      LAIV-mediated mucosal antibody responses, primarily IgA in the nose and IgG in 
      the lung. Pulmonary influenza-specific cellular responses were more apparent in 
      the LAIV group compared with either the TIV or an unvaccinated group. These 
      results indicate that TIV and LAIV elicit differential immunity to adults and 
      that LAIV immunogenicity is diminished by the nasal presence of S. pneumoniae. 
      Therefore, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may affect LAIV efficacy.

AB  - This is the third year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and yet most children remain 
      unvaccinated. COVID-19 in children manifests as mostly mild or asymptomatic, 
      however high viral titers and strong cellular and humoral responses are observed 
      upon acute infection. It is still unclear how long these responses persist, and 
      if they can protect from re-infection and/or disease severity. Here, we analyzed 
      immune memory responses in a cohort of children and adults with COVID-19. 
      Important differences between children and adults are evident in kinetics and 
      profile of memory responses. Children develop early N-specific cytotoxic T cell 
      responses, that rapidly expand and dominate their immune memory to the virus. 
      Children's anti-N, but not anti-S, antibody titers increase over time. 
      Neutralization titers correlate with N-specific antibodies and CD8(+)T cells. 
      However, antibodies generated by infection do not efficiently cross-neutralize 
      variants Gamma or Delta. Our results indicate that mechanisms that protect from 
      disease severity are possibly different from those that protect from reinfection, 
      bringing novel insights for pediatric vaccine design. They also underline the 
      importance of vaccination in children, who remain at risk for COVID-19 despite 
      having been previously infected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public health research frequently requires the integration of 
      information from different data sources. However, errors in the records and the 
      high computational costs involved make linking large administrative databases 
      using record linkage (RL) methodologies a major challenge. METHODS: We present 
      Tucuxi-BLAST, a versatile tool for probabilistic RL that utilizes a DNA-encoded 
      approach to encrypt, analyze and link massive administrative databases. 
      Tucuxi-BLAST encodes the identification records into DNA. BLASTn algorithm is 
      then used to align the sequences between databases. We tested and benchmarked on 
      a simulated database containing records for 300 million individuals and also on 
      four large administrative databases containing real data on Brazilian patients. 
      RESULTS: Our method was able to overcome misspellings and typographical errors in 
      administrative databases. In processing the RL of the largest simulated dataset 
      (200k records), the state-of-the-art method took 5 days and 7 h to perform the 
      RL, while Tucuxi-BLAST only took 23 h. When compared with five existing RL tools 
      applied to a gold-standard dataset from real health-related databases, 
      Tucuxi-BLAST had the highest accuracy and speed. By repurposing genomic tools, 
      Tucuxi-BLAST can improve data-driven medical research and provide a fast and 
      accurate way to link individual information across several administrative 
      databases.

      Arthralgia.
PG  - 914-922
LID - 10.3390/idr16050073 [doi]
AB  - Chikungunya fever (CHIKF), caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), manifests as 
      acute febrile illness often associated with polyarthritis and polyarthralgia. 
      Although the acute symptoms resolve within two weeks, many patients experience 
      prolonged joint pain and inflammation, resembling rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This 
      study aimed to identify molecular markers related to joint pain and chronicity in 
      CHIKV-infected individuals by analyzing blood transcriptomes using bulk RNA 
      sequencing. B- and T-cell receptor (BCR and TCR) diversity was assessed through 
      computational analysis of RNA-seq data, revealing a significant reduction in CDR3 
      diversity in CHIKV-infected individuals compared to healthy controls. This 
      reduced diversity was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in 
      osteoclast differentiation and activation, particularly through the RANK/RANKL 
      signaling pathway. These findings suggest a potential link between immune 
      dysregulation and enhanced osteoclast activity, which may contribute to the 
      persistence of joint pain in chronic CHIKF. Targeting osteoclast-related pathways 
      could offer therapeutic strategies for managing chronic symptoms in CHIKF 
      patients.

AB  - Vaccines have improved global health substantially, preventing millions of deaths 
      worldwide. However, striking variations in the immunogenicity and efficacy of 
      some vaccines persist across populations. Notably, suboptimal responses to some 
      vaccines, also known as vaccine hyporesponsiveness, have been observed in 
      low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income 
      countries or in rural areas within LMICs compared with urban areas within LMICs. 
      Environmental factors, host genetics, lifestyle, and nutrition contribute to 
      immunological variations influencing vaccine responses, highlighting the need to 
      identify key immune signatures that can be manipulated to overcome vaccine 
      hyporesponsiveness. The integration of diverse datasets, accelerated by 
      artificial intelligence, is essential to achieve this goal, which is currently 
      hampered by the under-representation of data from LMICs. The HypoVax Global 
      knowledge hub aims to address this gap by fostering international collaboration 
      and compiling globally representative immunological data from population studies 
      and vaccine trials. The hub offers a platform for high-dimensional data analyses, 
      promotes equitable partnerships, and strives to ensure that all contributions 
      lead to context-specific insights that can inform immunisation strategies to 
      ultimately overcome vaccine hyporesponsiveness.

PG  - 1299-1308
LID - 10.1038/s41590-018-0231-y [doi]
AB  - Colonization of the upper respiratory tract by pneumococcus is important both as 
      a determinant of disease and for transmission into the population. The 
      immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcus during colonization are well 
      studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of 
      pneumococcus following infection with influenza virus is associated with 
      secondary bacterial pneumonia. We used a human challenge model with type 6B 
      pneumococcus to show that acquisition of pneumococcus induced early degranulation 
      of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose. Monocyte 
      function was associated with the clearance of pneumococcus. Prior nasal infection 
      with live attenuated influenza virus induced inflammation, impaired innate immune 
      function and altered genome-wide nasal gene responses to the carriage of 
      pneumococcus. Levels of the cytokine CXCL10, promoted by viral infection, at the 
      time pneumococcus was encountered were positively associated with bacterial load.

AB  - COVID-19 manifests as a milder disease in children than adults, but the 
      underlying mechanisms are not fully characterized. Here we assess the difference 
      in cellular or humoral immune responses of pediatric and adult COVID-19 patients 
      to see if these factors contribute to the severity dichotomy. Children's 
      non-specific immune profile is dominated by naive lymphocytes and 
      HLA-DR(high)CX3CR1(low) dendritic cells; meanwhile, children show strong specific 
      antibody and T cell responses for viral structural proteins, with their T cell 
      responses differing from adults by having weaker CD8(+)TNF(+) T cells responses 
      to S peptide pool but stronger responses to N and M peptide pools. Finally, viral 
      mRNA is more abundant in pediatric patients. Our data thus support a scenario in 
      which SARS-CoV-2 infected children contribute to transmission yet are less 
      susceptible to COVID-19 symptoms due to strong and differential responses to the 
      virus.

AB  - Although increasing evidence confirms neuropsychiatric manifestations associated 
      mainly with severe COVID-19 infection, long-term neuropsychiatric dysfunction 
      (recently characterized as part of "long COVID-19" syndrome) has been frequently 
      observed after mild infection. We show the spectrum of cerebral impact of severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, ranging from 
      long-term alterations in mildly infected individuals (orbitofrontal cortical 
      atrophy, neurocognitive impairment, excessive fatigue and anxiety symptoms) to 
      severe acute damage confirmed in brain tissue samples extracted from the 
      orbitofrontal region (via endonasal transethmoidal access) from individuals who 
      died of COVID-19. In an independent cohort of 26 individuals who died of 
      COVID-19, we used histopathological signs of brain damage as a guide for possible 
      SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and found that among the 5 individuals who exhibited 
      those signs, all of them had genetic material of the virus in the brain. Brain 
      tissue samples from these five patients also exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. Supporting the hypothesis 
      of astrocyte infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes in vitro are 
      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a noncanonical mechanism that 
      involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested 
      changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel 
      neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, human 
      astrocyte infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal 
      viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, 
      infects astrocytes, and consequently, leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. 
      These deregulated processes could contribute to the structural and functional 
      alterations seen in the brains of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Canonical PI3Kγ signaling in myeloid cells restricts Trypanosoma cruzi infection 
      and dampens chagasic myocarditis.
PG  - 1513

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. 
      cruzi) and is an important cause of severe inflammatory heart disease. However, 
      the mechanisms driving Chagas disease cardiomyopathy have not been completely 
      elucidated. Here, we show that the canonical PI3Kγ pathway is upregulated in both 
      human chagasic hearts and hearts of acutely infected mice. PI3Kγ-deficient mice 
      and mutant mice carrying catalytically inactive PI3Kγ are more susceptible to T. 
      cruzi infection. The canonical PI3Kγ signaling in myeloid cells is essential to 
      restrict T. cruzi heart parasitism and ultimately to avoid myocarditis, heart 
      damage, and death of mice. Furthermore, high PIK3CG expression correlates with 
      low parasitism in human Chagas' hearts. In conclusion, these results indicate an 
      essential role of the canonical PI3Kγ signaling pathway in the control of T. 
      cruzi infection, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved 
      in the pathophysiology of chagasic heart disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disease that affects 
      millions of people worldwide. OBJECTIVES: The study protocol FHBGEP was design to 
      investigate the main genomic, epigenomic, and pharmacogenomic factors associated 
      with FH and polygenic hypercholesterolemia (PH). METHODS: FH patients will be 
      enrolled at six research centers in Brazil. An exon-targeted gene strategy will 
      be used to sequence a panel of 84 genes related to FH, PH, pharmacogenomics and 
      coronary artery disease. Variants in coding and regulatory regions will be 
      identified using a proposed variant discovery pipeline and classified according 
      to the American College Medical Genetics guidelines. Functional effects of 
      variants in FH-related genes will be investigated by in vitro studies using 
      lymphocytes and cell lines (HepG2, HUVEC and HEK293FT), CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, 
      luciferase reporter assay and other technologies. Functional studies in silico, 
      such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and conformational analysis, will 
      be used to explore the impact of novel variants on protein structure and 
      function. DNA methylation profile and differential expression of circulating 
      non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and lncRNAs) will be analyzed in FH patients and 
      normolipidemic subjects (control group). The influence of genomic and epigenomic 
      factors on metabolic and inflammatory status will be analyzed in FH patients. 
      Pharmacogenomic studies will be conducted to investigate the influence of genomic 
      and epigenomic factors on response to statins in FH patients. SUMMARY: The FHBGEP 
      protocol has the potential to elucidate the genetic basis and molecular 
      mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of FH and PH, particularly in the 
      Brazilian population. This pioneering approach includes genomic, epigenomic and 
      functional studies, which results will contribute to the improvement of the 
      diagnosis, prognosis and personalized therapy of FH patients.

TI  - Acute Inflammation Is a Predisposing Factor for Weight Gain and Insulin 
      Resistance.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030623 [doi]
LID - 623
AB  - In the course of infection and intense endotoxemia processes, induction of a 
      catabolic state leading to weight loss is observed in mice and humans. However, 
      the late effects of acute inflammation on energy homeostasis, regulation of body 
      weight and glucose metabolism are yet to be elucidated. Here, we addressed 
      whether serial intense endotoxemia, characterized by an acute phase response and 
      weight loss, could be an aggravating or predisposing factor to weight gain and 
      associated metabolic complications. Male Swiss Webster mice were submitted to 8 
      consecutive doses of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg LPS), followed by 10 weeks on a 
      high-fat diet (HFD). LPS-treated mice did not show changes in weight when fed 
      standard chow. However, when challenged by a high-fat diet, LPS-treated mice 
      showed greater weight gain, with larger fat depot areas, increased serum leptin 
      and insulin levels and impaired insulin sensitivity when compared to mice on HFD 
      only. Acute endotoxemia caused a long-lasting increase in mRNA expression of 
      inflammatory markers such as TLR-4, CD14 and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the adipose 
      tissue, which may represent the key factors connecting inflammation to increased 
      susceptibility to weight gain and impaired glucose homeostasis. In an independent 
      experimental model, and using publicly available microarray data from adipose 
      tissue from mice infected with Gram-negative bacteria, we performed gene set 
      enrichment analysis and confirmed upregulation of a set of genes responsible for 
      cell proliferation and inflammation, including TLR-4 and SAA. Together, we showed 
      that conditions leading to intense and recurring endotoxemia, such as common 
      childhood bacterial infections, may resound for a long time and aggravate the 
      effects of a western diet. If confirmed in humans, infections should be 
      considered an additional factor contributing to obesity and type 2 diabetes 
      epidemics.

TI  - Colorimetric RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic sensitivity relies on color 
      interpretation and viral load.

AB  - The use of RT-LAMP (reverse transcriptase-loop mediated isothermal amplification) 
      has been considered as a promising point-of-care method to diagnose COVID-19. In 
      this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 
      RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of 
      the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. We also demonstrated that 
      this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples 
      infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without 
      any viral infection. Although the majority of manuscripts recently published 
      using this technique describe only the presence of two-color states 
      (pink = negative and yellow = positive), we verified by naked-eye and absorbance 
      measurements that there is an evident third color cluster (orange), in general 
      related to positive samples with low viral loads, but which cannot be defined as 
      positive or negative by the naked eye. Orange colors should be repeated or tested 
      by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic. RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for 
      samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test. 
      All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 °C. The use of reaction time longer 
      than 30 min is also not recommended since nonspecific amplifications may cause 
      false positives.

AB  - Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic disease characterized by high 
      plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels and increased risk of 
      premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mutations in FH-related genes 
      account for 40% of FH cases worldwide. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
      pathogenic variants in FH-related genes in the Brazilian FH cohort FHBGEP using 
      exon-targeted gene sequencing (ETGS) strategy. FH patients (n = 210) were 
      enrolled at five clinical sites and peripheral blood samples were obtained for 
      laboratory testing and genomic DNA extraction. ETGS was performed using MiSeq 
      platform (Illumina). To identify deleterious variants in LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and 
      LDLRAP1, the long-reads were subjected to Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) for 
      alignment and mapping, followed by variant calling using Genome Analysis Toolkit 
      (GATK) and ANNOVAR for variant annotation. The variants were further filtered 
      using in-house custom scripts and classified according to the American College 
      Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. A total of 174 variants were 
      identified including 85 missense, 3 stop-gain, 9 splice-site, 6 InDel, and 71 in 
      regulatory regions (3'UTR and 5'UTR). Fifty-two patients (24.7%) had 30 known 
      pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in FH-related genes according to the 
      American College Medical and Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Fifty-three known 
      variants were classified as benign, or likely benign and 87 known variants have 
      shown uncertain significance. Four novel variants were discovered and classified 
      as such due to their absence in existing databases. In conclusion, ETGS and in 
      silico prediction studies are useful tools for screening deleterious variants and 
      identification of novel variants in FH-related genes, they also contribute to the 
      molecular diagnosis in the FHBGEP cohort.

AB  - Intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization induced by second messenger IP(3) controls many 
      cellular events in most of the eukaryotic groups. Despite the increasing evidence 
      of IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium, responsible 
      for malaria infection, no protein with potential function as an IP(3)-receptor 
      has been identified. The use of bioinformatic analyses based on previously known 
      sequences of IP(3)-receptor failed to identify potential IP(3)-receptor 
      candidates in any Apicomplexa. In this work, we combine the biochemical approach 
      of an IP(3) affinity chromatography column with bioinformatic meta-analyses to 
      identify potential vital membrane proteins that present binding with IP(3) 
      in Plasmodium falciparum. Our analyses reveal that PF3D7_0523000, a gene that 
      codes a transport protein associated with multidrug resistance as a potential 
      target for IP(3). This work provides a new insight for probing potential 
      candidates for IP(3)-receptor in Apicomplexa.

TI  - Expression of HMGCS2 in intestinal epithelial cells is downregulated in 
      inflammatory bowel disease associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Unfolded Protein Response, a mechanism triggered by the cell in 
      response to Endoplasmic reticulum stress, is linked to inflammatory responses. 
      Our aim was to identify novel Unfolded Protein Response-mechanisms that might be 
      involved in triggering or perpetuating the inflammatory response carried out by 
      the Intestinal Epithelial Cells in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of human Intestinal Epithelial 
      Cell lines treated with an Endoplasmic Reticulum stress inducer (thapsigargin) 
      and/or proinflammatory stimuli. Several genes were further analyzed in colonic 
      biopsies from Ulcerative Colitis patients and healthy controls. Lastly, we 
      generated Caco-2 cells lacking HMGCS2 by CRISPR Cas-9 and analyzed the functional 
      implications of its absence in Intestinal Epithelial Cells. RESULTS: Exposure to 
      a TLR ligand after thapsigargin treatment resulted in a powerful synergistic 
      modulation of gene expression, which led us to identify new genes and pathways 
      that could be involved in inflammatory responses linked to the Unfolded Protein 
      Response. Key differentially expressed genes in the array also exhibited 
      transcriptional alterations in colonic biopsies from active Ulcerative Colitis 
      patients, including NKG2D ligands and the enzyme HMGCS2. Moreover, functional 
      studies showed altered metabolic responses and epithelial barrier integrity in 
      HMGCS2 deficient cell lines. CONCLUSION: We have identified new genes and 
      pathways that are regulated by the Unfolded Protein Response in the context of 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease including HMGCS2, a gene involved in the metabolism of 
      Short Chain Fatty Acids that may have an important role in intestinal 
      inflammation linked to Endoplasmic Reticulum stress and the resolution of the 
      epithelial damage.

      susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.

AB  - Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by 
      affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from three pairs 
      of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived 
      from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection 
      the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature 
      of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. 
      Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have 
      significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome 
      analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 
      controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased 
      susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not 
      a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related 
      to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and systems biology analysis in stem cell research and 
      therapeutics development.
LID - 10.1093/stcltm/szaf037 [doi]
LID - szaf037
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem cell research has rapidly advanced during the past decades, but 
      the translation into approved clinical products is still lagging behind. Multiple 
      barriers to effective clinical translation exist. We hypothesize that an 
      ineffective use of the existing wealth of data from both product development and 
      clinical trials is a crucial barrier that hampers effective clinical 
      implementation of stem cell therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we summarize 
      the contribution of systems biology (SysBio) and artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      stem cell research and therapy development, to better understand and overcome 
      these barriers to effective clinical translation. Advancements in cell product 
      profiling technology, clinical trial design, and adjunct clinical monitoring, 
      offer new opportunities for a more integrated understanding of both, product and 
      patient performance. Synergy of SysBioAI analysis is boosting a more rapid, 
      integrated, and informative analysis of large‑scale multi‑omics data sets of 
      patient and clinical trial outcomes, thus enabling the "Iterative Circle of 
      Refined Clinical Translation". This SysBioAI‑supported concept can assist more 
      effective development and clinical use of stem cell therapeutics through 
      iterative adaptation cycles. This includes product‑ and patient‑centered clinical 
      safety and efficacy/potency evaluation through paired identification of suitable 
      biomarkers of clinical response. CONCLUSION: Integrated SysBioAI-use is a 
      powerful tool to optimize the design and outcomes of clinical trials by 
      identifying patient-specific responses, contributing to enhanced treatment safety 
      and efficacy, and to spur new patient-centric and adaptable next-generation 
      deep-medicine approaches.

TI  - P2x7 Receptor Signaling Blockade Reduces Lung Inflammation and Necrosis During 
      Severe Experimental Tuberculosis.
PG  - 672472

AB  - The risk of developing severe forms of tuberculosis has increased by the acquired 
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, lack of effective drugs to eliminate 
      latent infection and the emergence of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains. 
      Excessive inflammatory response and tissue damage associated with severe 
      tuberculosis contribute to poor outcome of the disease. Our previous studies 
      using mice deficient in the ATP-gated ionotropic P2X7 receptor suggested this 
      molecule as a promising target for host-directed therapy in severe pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. In this study, we assessed the effects of P2X7 pharmacological 
      blockade on disease severity. First, we observed an increase in P2RX7 gene 
      expression in the peripheral blood of tuberculosis patients compared to healthy 
      donors. Lung leukocytes of mice infected with hypervirulent mycobacteria also 
      showed increased expression of the P2X7 receptor. P2X7 blockade in mice with 
      advanced tuberculosis recapitulated in many aspects the disease in P2X7-deficient 
      mice. P2X7-directed therapy reduced body weight loss and the development of 
      inflammatory and necrotic lung lesions, as well as delayed mycobacterial growth. 
      Lower TNF-α production by lung cells and a substantial reduction in the lung 
      GR-1(+) myeloid cell population were observed after P2X7 inhibition. The effector 
      CD4(+) T cell population also decreased, but IFN-γ production by lung cells 
      increased. The presence of a large population with characteristics of myeloid 
      dendritic cells, as well as the increase in IL-6 production by lung cells, also 
      indicate a qualitative improvement in the pulmonary immune response due to P2X7 
      inhibition. These findings support the use of drugs that target the P2X7 receptor 
      as a therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis.

TI  - StructRNAfinder: an automated pipeline and web server for RNA families 
      prediction.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2052-2 [doi]
LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The function of many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) depend upon their 
      secondary structures. Over the last decades, several methodologies have been 
      developed to predict such structures or to use them to functionally annotate RNAs 
      into RNA families. However, to fully perform this analysis, researchers should 
      utilize multiple tools, which require the constant parsing and processing of 
      several intermediate files. This makes the large-scale prediction and annotation 
      of RNAs a daunting task even to researchers with good computational or 
      bioinformatics skills. RESULTS: We present an automated pipeline named 
      StructRNAfinder that predicts and annotates RNA families in transcript or genome 
      sequences. This single tool not only displays the sequence/structural consensus 
      alignments for each RNA family, according to Rfam database but also provides a 
      taxonomic overview for each assigned functional RNA. Moreover, we implemented a 
      user-friendly web service that allows researchers to upload their own nucleotide 
      sequences in order to perform the whole analysis. Finally, we provided a 
      stand-alone version of StructRNAfinder to be used in large-scale projects. The 
      tool was developed under GNU General Public License (GPLv3) and is freely 
      available at http://structrnafinder.integrativebioinformatics.me . CONCLUSIONS: 
      The main advantage of StructRNAfinder relies on the large-scale processing and 
      integrating the data obtained by each tool and database employed along the 
      workflow, of which several files are generated and displayed in user-friendly 
      reports, useful for downstream analyses and data exploration.

TI  - Systems biology of vaccination for seasonal influenza in humans.
PG  - 786-95

AB  - Here we have used a systems biology approach to study innate and adaptive 
      responses to vaccination against influenza in humans during three consecutive 
      influenza seasons. We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent 
      inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). 
      TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In 
      subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and 
      could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent 
      trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely 
      correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with 
      TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an 
      unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, 
      systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new 
      mechanistic insights about vaccines.

AB  - RePORT International is a global network of research sites in India, Brazil, 
      Indonesia, South Africa, China, and the Philippines dedicated to collaborative 
      tuberculosis research in the context of HIV. A standardized research protocol 
      (the Common Protocol) guides the enrollment of participants with active pulmonary 
      tuberculosis and contacts into observational cohorts. The establishment of 
      harmonized clinical data and bio-repositories will allow cutting-edge, 
      large-scale advances in the understanding of tuberculosis, including 
      identification of novel biomarkers for progression to active tuberculosis and 
      relapse after treatment. The RePORT International infrastructure aims to support 
      research capacity development through enabling globally-diverse collaborations. 
      To that end, representatives from the RePORT International network sites, funding 
      agencies, and other stakeholders gathered together in Brazil in September 2017 to 
      present updates on relevant research findings and discuss ideas for 
      collaboration. Presenters emphasized research involving biomarker identification 
      for incipient tuberculosis, host immunity and pharmacogenomics, co-morbidities 
      such as HIV and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and tuberculosis transmission in 
      vulnerable and high-risk populations. Currently, 962 active TB participants and 
      670 household contacts have contributed blood, sputum, urine and microbes to 
      in-country biorepositories. Cross-consortium collaborations have begun sharing 
      data and specimens to analyze molecular and cytokine predictive patterns.

TI  - Why should obese youth be prioritized in COVID-19 vaccination programs? A 
      nationwide retrospective study.
PG  - 100167

AB  - BACKGROUND: The dominant effect of age on COVID-19 mortality obscures the impact 
      of other risk factors. Although the elderly is at a greater risk of severe 
      disease and death due to COVID-19, the interaction of obesity and age was not 
      carefully assessed. This analysis is especially critical for prioritizing groups 
      to receive COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Starting with 1,120,767 unvaccinated 
      individuals registered in a Brazilian surveillance system, we selected 313,898 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 20 to 89 who had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) and 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or diabetes, as well as individuals with no risk 
      factors associated with severe COVID-19. Patient data were stratified by age, 
      obesity, BMI, and comorbidities, and subsequently, subjected to crude and 
      adjusted odds ratio, hazard ratio, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Disease outcomes were 
      invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) 
      admission, and death. FINDINGS: Obesity alone is a risk factor for in-hospital 
      mortality and is more significant than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
      Furthermore, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes increase the risk of 
      severity and death by COVID-19 more significantly in young adults than in the 
      elderly. When categorizing patients by obesity classes, the severity of obesity 
      was found to be associated with a higher risk of admission to the ICU and death 
      from COVID-19 than the non-obese young adults or elderly population. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the increased risk of severe COVID-19 on 
      the Brazilian obese youth. As SARS-CoV-2 may become a recurrent seasonal 
      infection, future vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 should prioritize obese 
      young individuals. FUNDINGS: This work was supported by the Brazilian National 
      Council for Scientific and Technological Development (grant number 313662/2017-7 
      and 307356/2017-5; the São Paulo Research Foundation (grant numbers 
      2018/14933-2); and CAPES.

TI  - Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 regulates hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cell regeneration.
PG  - e3076
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2017.474 [doi]
AB  - Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are predominantly quiescent in 
      adults, but proliferate in response to bone marrow (BM) injury. Here, we show 
      that deletion of Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 
      (CaMKK2) promotes HSPC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery following 
      radiation injury. Using Camkk2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter 
      mice, we found that Camkk2 expression is developmentally regulated in HSPC. 
      Deletion of Camkk2 in HSPC results in a significant downregulation of genes 
      affiliated with the quiescent signature. Accordingly, HSPC from Camkk2 null mice 
      have a high proliferative capability when stimulated in vitro in the presence of 
      BM-derived endothelial cells. In addition, Camkk2 null mice are more resistant to 
      radiation injury and show accelerated hematopoietic recovery, enhanced HSPC 
      regeneration and ultimately a prolonged survival following sublethal or lethal 
      total body irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that CaMKK2 regulates the 
      HSPC response to hematopoietic damage by coupling radiation signaling to 
      activation of the anti-proliferative AMP-activated protein kinase. Finally, we 
      demonstrated that systemic administration of the small molecule CaMKK2 inhibitor, 
      STO-609, to irradiated mice enhanced HSPC recovery and improved survival. These 
      findings identify CaMKK2 as an important regulator of HSPC regeneration and 
      demonstrate CaMKK2 inhibition is a novel approach to promoting hematopoietic 
      recovery after BM injury.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 7 
      million people in Latin American areas of endemicity. About 30% of infected 
      patients will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory 
      cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocarditis. Further 
      studies are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease 
      progression. Transcriptome analysis has been increasingly used to identify 
      molecular changes associated with disease outcomes. We thus assessed the 
      whole-blood transcriptome of patients with Chagas disease. Microarray analysis 
      was performed on blood samples from 150 subjects, of whom 30 were uninfected 
      control patients and 120 had Chagas disease (1 group had asymptomatic disease, 
      and 2 groups had CCC with either a preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection 
      fraction [LVEF]). Each Chagas disease group displayed distinct gene expression 
      and functional pathway profiles. The most different expression patterns were 
      between CCC groups with a preserved or reduced LVEF. A more stringent analysis 
      indicated that 27 differentially expressed genes, particularly those related to 
      natural killer (NK)/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, separated the 2 groups. NK/CD8+ 
      T-cell cytotoxicity could play a role in determining Chagas disease progression. 
      Understanding genes associated with disease may lead to improved insight into CCC 
      pathogenesis and the identification of prognostic factors for CCC progression.

AB  - Chagas disease is a life-threatening illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma 
      cruzi. The diagnosis of the acute form of the disease is performed by trained 
      microscopists who detect parasites in blood smear samples. Since this method 
      requires a dedicated high-resolution camera system attached to the microscope, 
      the diagnostic method is more expensive and often prohibitive for low-income 
      settings. Here, we present a machine learning approach based on a random forest 
      (RF) algorithm for the detection and counting of T. cruzi trypomastigotes in 
      mobile phone images. We analyzed micrographs of blood smear samples that were 
      acquired using a mobile device camera capable of capturing images in a resolution 
      of 12 megapixels. We extracted a set of features that describe morphometric 
      parameters (geometry and curvature), as well as color, and texture measurements 
      of 1,314 parasites. The features were divided into train and test sets (4:1) and 
      classified using the RF algorithm. The values of precision, sensitivity, and area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the proposed method 
      were 87.6%, 90.5%, and 0.942, respectively. Automating image analysis acquired 
      with a mobile device is a viable alternative for reducing costs and gaining 
      efficiency in the use of the optical microscope.

TI  - SerpinB2 inhibits migration and promotes a resolution phase signature in large 
      peritoneal macrophages.
PG  - 12421
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-48741-w [doi]
LID - 12421
AB  - SerpinB2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2) has been called the "undecided 
      serpin" with no clear consensus on its physiological role, although it is well 
      described as an inhibitor of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). In 
      macrophages, pro-inflammatory stimuli usually induce SerpinB2; however, 
      expression is constitutive in Gata6+ large peritoneal macrophages (LPM). 
      Interrogation of expression data from human macrophages treated with a range of 
      stimuli using a new bioinformatics tool, CEMiTool, suggested that SerpinB2 is 
      most tightly co- and counter-regulated with genes associated with cell movement. 
      Using LPM from SerpinB2(-/-) and SerpinB2(R380A) (active site mutant) mice, we 
      show that migration on Matrigel was faster than for their wild-type controls. 
      Confocal microscopy illustrated that SerpinB2 and F-actin staining overlapped in 
      focal adhesions and lamellipodia. Genes associated with migration and 
      extracellular matrix interactions were also identified by RNA-Seq analysis of 
      migrating RPM from wild-type and SerpinB2(R380A) mice. Subsequent gene set 
      enrichment analyses (GSEA) suggested SerpinB2 counter-regulates many 
      Gata6-regulated genes associated with migration. These data argue that the role 
      of SerpinB2 in macrophages is inhibition of uPA-mediated plasmin generation 
      during cell migration. GSEA also suggested that SerpinB2 expression (likely via 
      ensuing modulation of uPA-receptor/integrin signaling) promotes the adoption of a 
      resolution phase signature.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of vaccine-elicited protection contributes to the 
      development of new vaccines. The emerging field of systems vaccinology provides 
      detailed information on host responses to vaccination and has been successfully 
      applied to study the molecular mechanisms of several vaccines. Long noncoding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucially involved in multiple biological processes, but their 
      role in vaccine-induced immunity has not been explored. We performed an analysis 
      of over 2,000 blood transcriptome samples from 17 vaccine cohorts to identify 
      lncRNAs potentially involved with antibody responses to influenza and yellow 
      fever vaccines. We have created an online database where all results from this 
      analysis can be accessed easily. We found that lncRNAs participate in distinct 
      immunological pathways related to vaccine-elicited responses. Among them, we 
      showed that the expression of lncRNA FAM30A was high in B cells and correlates 
      with the expression of immunoglobulin genes located in its genomic vicinity. We 
      also identified altered expression of these lncRNAs in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      data from a cohort of children following immunization with intranasal live 
      attenuated influenza vaccine, suggesting a common role across several diverse 
      vaccines. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that lncRNAs have a 
      significant impact on immune responses induced by vaccination.

TI  - Exacerbation of Chikungunya Virus Rheumatic Immunopathology by a High Fiber Diet 
      and Butyrate.
PG  - 2736

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito transmitted alphavirus associated with a 
      robust systemic infection and an acute inflammatory rheumatic disease. A high 
      fiber diet has been widely promoted for its ability to ameliorate inflammatory 
      diseases. Fiber is fermented in the gut into short chain fatty acids such as 
      acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which enter the circulation providing systemic 
      anti-inflammatory activities. Herein we show that mice fed a high fiber diet show 
      a clear exacerbation of CHIKV arthropathy, with increased edema and neutrophil 
      infiltrates. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that a high fiber diet, in this 
      setting, promoted a range of pro-neutrophil responses including Th17/IL-17. Gene 
      Set Enrichment Analyses demonstrated significant similarities with mouse models 
      of inflammatory psoriasis and significant depression of macrophage resolution 
      phase signatures in the CHIKV arthritic lesions from mice fed a high fiber diet. 
      Supplementation of the drinking water with butyrate also increased edema after 
      CHIKV infection. However, the mechanisms involved were different, with modulation 
      of AP-1 and NF-κB responses identified, potentially implicating deoptimization of 
      endothelial barrier repair. Thus, neither fiber nor short chain fatty acids 
      provided benefits in this acute infectious disease setting, which is 
      characterized by widespread viral cytopathic effects and a need for tissue 
      repair.

TI  - Biological sex influences antibody responses to routine vaccinations in the first 
      year of life.
PG  - 147-157
LID - 10.1111/apa.14932 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We investigated the effect of early-life factors, namely sex, delivery mode, 
      feeding method and antibiotic exposure, on antibody responses to routine 
      vaccinations administered during the first year of life. METHODS: One and seven 
      months after the primary course of routine vaccines and 1 month after routine 
      vaccines at 12 months of age, antibodies against 26 vaccine antigens were 
      measured in 398 healthy infants. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 
      antibodies (adjusted for effect modifiers with multiple linear regression) and 
      the seroprotection rate for each vaccine were compared for each early-life 
      factor. RESULTS: Sex had an influence on GMCs. Antibody concentrations were 
      significantly lower at 7 months of age in females for tetanus and filamentous 
      haemagglutinin and at 13 months of age for pertactin. In contrast, at 13 months 
      of age, antibody concentrations were significantly higher in females for polio 
      type 3, pneumococcal serotype 6A and measles. Sex did not have an influence on 
      seroprotection rates. Delivery mode, feeding method and antibiotic exposure did 
      not exert a substantial influence on vaccine antibody concentrations. CONCLUSION: 
      There is a difference between males and females in the humoral response to 
      routine vaccinations in the first year of life.

LID - 10.1126/science.1246829 [doi]
AB  - The yellow fever vaccine YF-17D is one of the most successful vaccines ever 
      developed in humans. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in more than 600 
      million people, the mechanisms by which it stimulates protective immunity remain 
      poorly understood. Recent studies using systems biology approaches in humans have 
      revealed that YF-17D-induced early expression of general control nonderepressible 
      2 kinase (GCN2) in the blood strongly correlates with the magnitude of the later 
      CD8(+) T cell response. We demonstrate a key role for virus-induced GCN2 
      activation in programming dendritic cells to initiate autophagy and enhanced 
      antigen presentation to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results reveal an 
      unappreciated link between virus-induced integrated stress response in dendritic 
      cells and the adaptive immune response.

TI  - Molecular alterations in the extracellular matrix in the brains of newborns with 
      congenital Zika syndrome.
LID - eaay6736 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aay6736 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can cause a set of severe 
      abnormalities in the fetus known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Experiments 
      with animal models and in vitro systems have substantially contributed to our 
      understanding of the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection. Here, to investigate the 
      molecular basis of CZS in humans, we used a systems biology approach to integrate 
      transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic data from the postmortem brains of 
      neonates with CZS. We observed that collagens were greatly reduced in expression 
      in CZS brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS had 
      several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in collagen-encoding genes that are 
      associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. These findings were 
      validated by immunohistochemistry and comparative analysis of collagen abundance 
      in ZIKV-infected and uninfected samples. In addition, we showed a ZIKV-dependent 
      increase in the expression of cell adhesion factors that are essential for 
      neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, findings that are consistent with the 
      neuronal migration defects observed in CZS. Together, these findings provide 
      insights into the underlying molecular alterations in the ZIKV-infected brain and 
      reveal host genes associated with CZS susceptibility.

AB  - The COVID-19 vaccinations have played a significant role in controlling the 
      pandemic. To elucidate their impact on the immune system, a COVID-19 vaccination 
      atlas was developed using an integrative systems vaccinology approach. The atlas 
      includes 562 samples from 245 participants, including both healthy individuals 
      and those infected with or without prior vaccination, and covers the 
      administration of five vaccines in different regimens. Key findings include the 
      identification of distinct immune markers that differentiate between vaccine 
      types and infection statuses. We observed that mRNA vaccines induced transient 
      but strong immune responses after booster doses, whereas viral vector vaccines 
      showed sustained immune activation with infection, partially resembling the 
      immune profile exhibited during infection. Heterologous vaccination regimens 
      demonstrated enhanced immune diversification compared to homologous regimens. 
      Finally, we described the immunological landscape of COVID-19 vaccines and 
      vaccines against other pathogens, at the gene-level and in cell population 
      dynamics.

AB  - Vaccines are very effective at preventing infectious disease but not all 
      recipients mount a protective immune response to vaccination. Recently, gene 
      expression profiles of PBMC samples in vaccinated individuals have been used to 
      predict the development of protective immunity. However, the magnitude of change 
      in gene expression that separates vaccine responders and nonresponders is likely 
      to be small and distributed across networks of genes, making the selection of 
      predictive and biologically relevant genes difficult. Here we apply a new 
      approach to predicting vaccine response based on coordinated upregulation of sets 
      of biologically informative genes in postvaccination gene expression profiles. We 
      found that enrichment of gene sets related to proliferation and immunoglobulin 
      genes accurately segregated high responders to influenza vaccination from low 
      responders and achieved a prediction accuracy of 88% in an independent clinical 
      trial. Many of the genes in these gene sets would not have been identified using 
      conventional, single-gene level approaches because of their subtle upregulation 
      in vaccine responders. Our results demonstrate that gene set enrichment method 
      can capture subtle transcriptional changes and may be a generally useful approach 
      for developing and interpreting predictive models of the human immune response.

      seasonal influenza vaccination.

AB  - Systems biological analysis of immunity to the trivalent inactivated influenza 
      vaccine (TIV) in humans revealed a correlation between early expression of TLR5 
      and the magnitude of the antibody response. Vaccination of Trl5(-/-) mice 
      resulted in reduced antibody titers and lower frequencies of plasma cells, 
      demonstrating a role for TLR5 in immunity to TIV. This was due to a failure to 
      sense host microbiota. Thus, antibody responses in germ-free or 
      antibiotic-treated mice were impaired, but restored by oral reconstitution with a 
      flagellated, but not aflagellated, strain of E. coli. TLR5-mediated sensing of 
      flagellin promoted plasma cell differentiation directly and by stimulating lymph 
      node macrophages to produce plasma cell growth factors. Finally, TLR5-mediated 
      sensing of the microbiota also impacted antibody responses to the inactivated 
      polio vaccine, but not to adjuvanted vaccines or the live-attenuated yellow fever 
      vaccine. These results reveal an unappreciated role for gut microbiota in 
      promoting immunity to vaccination.

TI  - Systems analysis of protective immune responses to RTS,S malaria vaccination in 
      humans.
PG  - 2425-2430
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1621489114 [doi]
AB  - RTS,S is an advanced malaria vaccine candidate and confers significant protection 
      against Plasmodium falciparum infection in humans. Little is known about the 
      molecular mechanisms driving vaccine immunity. Here, we applied a systems biology 
      approach to study immune responses in subjects receiving three consecutive 
      immunizations with RTS,S (RRR), or in those receiving two immunizations of 
      RTS,S/AS01 following a primary immunization with adenovirus 35 (Ad35) (ARR) 
      vector expressing circumsporozoite protein. Subsequent controlled human malaria 
      challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after 
      the final immunization, resulted in ∼50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. 
      Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were 
      associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower 
      antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4(+) 
      T-cell responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and 
      plasma cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers 
      prechallenge and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of 
      innate immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with 
      protection in the ARR cohort. For both vaccine regimens, natural killer (NK) cell 
      signatures negatively correlated with and predicted protection. These results 
      suggest that protective immunity against P. falciparum can be achieved via 
      multiple mechanisms and highlight the utility of systems approaches in defining 
      molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.

TI  - Genomic positional conservation identifies topological anchor point RNAs linked 
      to developmental loci.
PG  - 32

LID - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mammalian genome is transcribed into large numbers of long 
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the definition of functional lncRNA groups has 
      proven difficult, partly due to their low sequence conservation and lack of 
      identified shared properties. Here we consider promoter conservation and 
      positional conservation as indicators of functional commonality. RESULTS: We 
      identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human that are preserved in 
      genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. These positionally 
      conserved lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription 
      factor loci with which they are coexpressed in a tissue-specific manner. Over 
      half of positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to chromatin 
      organization structures, overlapping binding sites for the CTCF chromatin 
      organiser and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of 
      topologically associating domains (TADs). We define these RNAs as topological 
      anchor point RNAs (tapRNAs). Characterization of these noncoding RNAs and their 
      associated coding genes shows that they are functionally connected: they regulate 
      each other's expression and influence the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells in 
      vitro in a similar fashion. Furthermore, we find that tapRNAs contain conserved 
      sequence domains that are enriched in motifs for zinc finger domain-containing 
      RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors, whose binding sites are found 
      mutated in cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This work leverages positional conservation to 
      identify lncRNAs with potential importance in genome organization, development 
      and disease. The evidence that many developmental transcription factors are 
      physically and functionally connected to lncRNAs represents an exciting 
      stepping-stone to further our understanding of genome regulation.

TI  - N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA) Receptor Blockade Prevents Neuronal Death Induced by 
      Zika Virus Infection.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00350-17 [doi]
LID - e00350-17
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global health emergency that causes significant 
      neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative processes may be exacerbated by 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent neuronal excitoxicity. Here, we 
      have exploited the hypothesis that ZIKV-induced neurodegeneration can be rescued 
      by blocking NMDA overstimulation with memantine. Our results show that ZIKV 
      actively replicates in primary neurons and that virus replication is directly 
      associated with massive neuronal cell death. Interestingly, treatment with 
      memantine or other NMDAR blockers, including dizocilpine (MK-801), agmatine 
      sulfate, or ifenprodil, prevents neuronal death without interfering with the 
      ability of ZIKV to replicate in these cells. Moreover, in vivo experiments 
      demonstrate that therapeutic memantine treatment prevents the increase of 
      intraocular pressure (IOP) induced by infection and massively reduces 
      neurodegeneration and microgliosis in the brain of infected mice. Our results 
      indicate that the blockade of NMDARs by memantine provides potent neuroprotective 
      effects against ZIKV-induced neuronal damage, suggesting it could be a viable 
      treatment for patients at risk for ZIKV infection-induced 
      neurodegeneration.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global health 
      emergency associated with serious neurological complications, including 
      microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Infection of experimental animals with 
      ZIKV causes significant neuronal damage and microgliosis. Treatment with drugs 
      that block NMDARs prevented neuronal damage both in vitro and in vivo These 
      results suggest that overactivation of NMDARs contributes significantly to the 
      neuronal damage induced by ZIKV infection, and this is amenable to inhibition by 
      drug treatment.

TI  - RNA-Binding Protein Musashi1 Is a Central Regulator of Adhesion Pathways in 
      Glioblastoma.
PG  - 2965-78
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00410-15 [doi]
AB  - The conserved RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (MSI1) has emerged as a key oncogenic 
      factor in numerous solid tumors, including glioblastoma. However, its mechanism 
      of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target 
      genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences 
      glioblastoma phenotypes, we conducted individual-nucleotide resolution 
      cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1 
      has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context, 
      especially in 3' untranslated regions. Although numerous binding sites were also 
      identified in intronic sequences, our RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis does 
      not favor the idea that MSI1 is a major regulator of splicing in glioblastoma 
      cells. MSI1 target mRNAs encode proteins that function in multiple pathways of 
      cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Since these associations indicate 
      potentially new roles for MSI1, we investigated its impact on glioblastoma cell 
      adhesion, morphology, migration, and invasion. These processes are known to 
      underpin the spread and relapse of glioblastoma, in contrast to other tumors 
      where metastasis is the main driver of recurrence and progression.

TI  - Crucial role for T cell-intrinsic IL-18R-MyD88 signaling in cognate immune 
      response to intracellular parasite infection.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.30883 [doi]
LID - e30883
AB  - MyD88 is the main adaptor molecule for TLR and IL-1R family members. Here, we 
      demonstrated that T-cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling is required for proliferation, 
      protection from apoptosis and expression of activation/memory genes during 
      infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, as evidenced by 
      transcriptome and cytometry analyses in mixed bone-marrow (BM) chimeras. The lack 
      of direct IL-18R signaling in T cells, but not of IL-1R, phenocopied the absence 
      of the MyD88 pathway, indicating that IL-18R is a critical MyD88-upstream pathway 
      involved in the establishment of the Th1 response against an in vivo infection, a 
      presently controvert subject. Accordingly, Il18r1(-/-) mice display lower levels 
      of Th1 cells and are highly susceptible to infection, but can be rescued from 
      mortality by the adoptive transfer of WT CD4(+) T cells. Our findings establish 
      the T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 pathway as a crucial element for induction of 
      cognate Th1 responses against an important human pathogen.

TI  - Kdm6b Regulates the Generation of Effector CD8(+) T Cells by Inducing Chromatin 
      Accessibility in Effector-Associated Genes.
PG  - 2170-2183
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2001459 [doi]
AB  - The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of CD8(+) T cell differentiation is 
      critical for balancing pathogen eradication and long-term immunity by effector 
      and memory CTLs, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that the lysine 
      demethylase 6b (Kdm6b) is essential for the proper generation and function of 
      effector CD8(+) T cells during acute infection and tumor eradication. We found 
      that cells lacking Kdm6b (by either T cell-specific knockout mice or knockdown 
      using short hairpin RNA strategies) show an enhanced generation of memory 
      precursor and early effector cells upon acute viral infection in a cell-intrinsic 
      manner. We also demonstrate that Kdm6b is indispensable for proper effector 
      functions and tumor protection, and that memory CD8(+) T cells lacking Kdm6b 
      displayed a defective recall response. Mechanistically, we identified that Kdm6b, 
      through induction of chromatin accessibility in key effector-associated gene 
      loci, allows for the proper generation of effector CTLs. Our results pinpoint the 
      essential function of Kdm6b in allowing chromatin accessibility in 
      effector-associated genes, and identify Kdm6b as a potential target for 
      therapeutics in diseases with dysregulated effector responses.

AB  - Glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction and the early involvement of the 
      hippocampus have been proposed to be important aspects of the pathophysiology of 
      schizophrenia. Here, we performed proteomic analysis of hippocampus postmortem 
      samples from schizophrenia patients as well as neural cells-neurons and 
      oligodendrocytes-treated with MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist. There were 
      similarities in processes such as oxidative stress and apoptotic process when 
      comparing hippocampus samples with MK-801-treated neurons, and in proteins 
      synthesis when comparing hippocampus samples with MK-801-treated 
      oligodendrocytes. This reveals that studying the effects of glutamatergic 
      dysfunction in different neural cells can contribute to a better understanding of 
      what it is observed in schizophrenia patients' postmortem brains.

AB  - Platelets drive endothelial cell activation in many diseases. However, if this 
      occurs in Plasmodium vivax malaria is unclear. As platelets have been reported to 
      be activated and to play a role in inflammatory response during malaria, we 
      hypothesized that this would correlate with endothelial alterations during acute 
      illness. We performed platelet flow cytometry of PAC-1 and P-selectin. We 
      measured platelet markers (CXCL4, CD40L, P-selectin, Thrombopoietin, IL-11) and 
      endothelial activation markers (ICAM-1, von Willebrand Factor and E-selectin) in 
      plasma with a multiplex-based assay. The values of each mediator were used to 
      generate heatmaps, K-means clustering and Principal Component analysis. In 
      addition, we determined pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficients to generate 
      correlation networks. Platelet counts were reduced, and mean platelet volume 
      increased in malaria patients. The activation of circulating platelets in flow 
      cytometry did not differ between patients and controls. CD40L levels (Median 
      [IQ]: 517 [406-651] vs. 1029 [732-1267] pg/mL, P = 0.0001) were significantly 
      higher in patients, while P-selectin and CXCL4 showed a nonsignificant trend 
      towards higher levels in patients. The network correlation approach demonstrated 
      the correlation between markers of platelet and endothelial activation, and the 
      heatmaps revealed a distinct pattern of activation in two subsets of P. vivax 
      patients when compared to controls. Although absolute platelet activation was not 
      strong in uncomplicated vivax malaria, markers of platelet activity and 
      production were correlated with higher endothelial cell activation, especially in 
      a specific subset of patients.

TI  - The relationship between cytokine and neutrophil gene network distinguishes 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by sex and age.

AB  - The fact that the COVID-19 fatality rate varies by sex and age is poorly 
      understood. Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the 
      control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of 
      uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with 
      publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood 
      leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and 
      young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a 
      stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between 
      upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This 
      was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, 
      while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The 
      association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a 
      strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced 
      transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as 
      CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1β, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with 
      male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory 
      damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways 
      associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a 
      possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and 
      neutrophil transcriptional signatures.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptide LL-37 participates in the transcriptional regulation of 
      melanoma cells.
PG  - 2341-2345
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are an ancient family of molecules that emerged millions 
      of years ago and have been strongly conserved during the evolutionary process of 
      living organisms. Recently, our group described that the human antimicrobial 
      peptide LL-37 migrates to the nucleus, raising the possibility that LL-37 could 
      directly modulate transcription under certain conditions. Here, we showed 
      evidence that LL-37 binds to gene promoter regions, and LL-37 gene silencing 
      changed the transcriptional program of melanoma A375 cells genes associated with 
      histone, metabolism, cellular stress, ubiquitination and mitochondria.

AB  - Sepsis results from a dyshomeostatic response to infection, which may lead to 
      hyper or hypoimmune states. Monocytes are central regulators of the inflammatory 
      response, but our understanding of their role in the genesis and resolution of 
      sepsis is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive exploration of monocyte 
      molecular responses in a cohort of patients with septic shock via proteomic 
      profiling. The acute stage of septic shock was associated with an impaired 
      inflammatory phenotype, indicated by the down-regulation of MHC class II 
      molecules and proinflammatory cytokine pathways. Simultaneously, there was an 
      up-regulation of glycolysis enzymes and a decrease in proteins related to the 
      citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, the 
      restoration of immunocompetence was the hallmark of recovering patients, in which 
      an upregulation of interferon signaling pathways was a notable feature. Our 
      results provide insights into the immunopathology of sepsis and propose that, 
      pending future studies, immunometabolism pathway components could serve as 
      therapeutic targets in septic patients.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect a 
      broad range of human tissues by using the host receptor angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2 (ACE2). Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 
      display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without 
      comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and 
      hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here, we showed that patients 
      with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues 
      compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE 
      may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in 
      reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and higher viral load upon 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of 1,357 COVID-19 
      patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 
      3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs. Our work 
      suggests that pH has a great influence on SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 
      severity.

TI  - The amino acid sensor GCN2 controls gut inflammation by inhibiting inflammasome 
      activation.
PG  - 523-527

AB  - The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which 
      eukaryotic cells sense and respond to stress-inducing signals, such as amino acid 
      starvation. General controlled non-repressed (GCN2) kinase is a key orchestrator 
      of the ISR, and modulates protein synthesis in response to amino acid starvation. 
      Here we demonstrate in mice that GCN2 controls intestinal inflammation by 
      suppressing inflammasome activation. Enhanced activation of ISR was observed in 
      intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells during amino acid 
      starvation, or intestinal inflammation. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 (also known as 
      Eif2ka4) in CD11c(+) APCs or intestinal epithelial cells resulted in enhanced 
      intestinal inflammation and T helper 17 cell (TH17) responses, owing to enhanced 
      inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β production. This was caused by 
      reduced autophagy in Gcn2(-/-) intestinal APCs and epithelial cells, leading to 
      increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potent activator of inflammasomes. 
      Thus, conditional ablation of Atg5 or Atg7 in intestinal APCs resulted in 
      enhanced ROS and TH17 responses. Furthermore, in vivo blockade of ROS and IL-1β 
      resulted in inhibition of TH17 responses and reduced inflammation in Gcn2(-/-) 
      mice. Importantly, acute amino acid starvation suppressed intestinal inflammation 
      via a mechanism dependent on GCN2. These results reveal a mechanism that couples 
      amino acid sensing with control of intestinal inflammation via GCN2.

AB  - We measured plasma-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins and their microRNA 
      (miRNA) cargos in normoglycemic (NG), glucose intolerant (GI), and newly 
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) in middle-aged male participants of the 
      Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brazil). Mass spectrometry 
      revealed decreased IGHG-1 and increased ITIH2 protein levels in the GI group 
      compared with that in the NG group and higher serotransferrin in EVs in the DM 
      group than in those in the NG and GI groups. The GI group also showed increased 
      serum ferritin levels, as evaluated by biochemical analysis, compared with those 
      in both groups. Seventeen miRNAs were differentially expressed (DEMiRs) in the 
      plasma EVs of the three groups. DM patients showed upregulation of miR-141-3p and 
      downregulation of miR-324-5p and -376c-3p compared with the NG and GI groups. The 
      DM and GI groups showed increased miR-26b-5p expression compared with that in the 
      NG group. The DM group showed decreased miR-374b-5p levels compared with those in 
      the GI group and higher concentrations than those in the NG group. Thus, three EV 
      proteins and five DEMiR cargos have potential prognostic importance for diabetic 
      complications mainly associated with the immune function and iron status of GI 
      and DM patients.

PG  - e70742

LID - e70742
AB  - Hepatitis is a systemic disease marked by neuroimmune dysregulation beyond 
      hepatic inflammation. Using a systems biology approach, we conducted 
      transcriptomic meta-analyses across in vitro models, liver tissues, and PBMCs 
      from hepatitis virus-infected patients to identify neuroimmune signatures. We 
      found a robust neuroimmunome signature, with neuroimmune-related genes showing 
      consistent differential expression across datasets. Functional enrichment 
      revealed disruptions in neurotransmission (including synaptic, glutamatergic, 
      noradrenergic and neuregulin pathways) and immune signaling (such as cytokines, 
      interleukin-1 response, T cell receptor, and trans-synaptic signaling). Linear 
      discriminant analysis (LDA) demonstrated that neuroimmune genes can predict 
      disease severity. Several of these genes were also altered in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), implicating 
      them in oncogenic transformation. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed dysregulated 
      neuroimmune interactions in liver tissue, notably involving DBH-ADRA1A/B/D, 
      ADRA2A/B/C, ADRB1/2/3, IL33-IL1RL1, and NRG1-ERBB4. Critically, we observed an 
      inverse correlation between neuroimmune gene expression and inflammation markers 
      in advanced HCC, suggesting that neuroimmune suppression may facilitate immune 
      evasion. These findings highlight the neuroimmunome as a potential biomarker and 
      therapeutic target in hepatitis and its complications, reinforcing the role of 
      neuroimmune crosstalk in liver disease progression.

TI  - Transcriptomic signatures induced by the Ebola virus vaccine rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in 
      adult cohorts in Europe, Africa, and North America: a molecular biomarker study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the Zaire 
      Ebola virus glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) vaccine has been reported as safe, 
      immunogenic, and highly protective in a ring vaccination trial. We aimed to 
      identify transcriptomic immune response biomarker signatures induced by 
      vaccination and associated signatures with its immunogenicity and reactogenicity 
      to better understand the potential mechanisms of action of the vaccine. METHODS: 
      354 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated in randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trials in Europe (Geneva, Switzerland [November, 2014, to 
      January, 2015]) and North America (USA [Dec 5, 2014, to June 23, 2015]), and 
      dose-escalation trials in Africa (Lambaréné, Gabon [November, 2014, to January, 
      2015], and Kilifi, Kenya [December, 2014, to January, 2015]) using different 
      doses of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the Zaire 
      Ebola virus glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP; 3 × 10(5) to 1 × 10(8) plaque-forming 
      units [pfu]). Longitudinal transcriptomic responses (days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 
      28) were measured in whole blood using a targeted gene expression profiling 
      platform (dual-colour reverse-transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification) focusing on 144 immune-related genes. The effect of time and dose 
      on transcriptomic response was also assessed. Logistic regression with lasso 
      regularisation was applied to identify host signatures with optimal 
      discriminatory capability of vaccination at day 1 or day 7 versus baseline, 
      whereas random-effects models and recursive feature elimination combined with 
      regularised logistic regression were used to associate signatures with 
      immunogenicity and reactogenicity. FINDINGS: Our results indicated that 
      perturbation of gene expression peaked on day 1 and returned to baseline levels 
      between day 7 and day 28. The magnitude of the response was dose-dependent, with 
      vaccinees receiving a high dose (≥9 × 10(6) pfu) of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP exhibiting 
      the largest amplitude. The most differentially expressed genes that were 
      significantly upregulated following vaccination consisted of type I and II 
      interferon-related genes and myeloid cell-associated markers, whereas T cell, 
      natural killer cell, and cytotoxicity-associated genes were downregulated. A gene 
      signature associated with immunogenicity (common to all four cohorts) was 
      identified correlating gene expression profiles with ZEBOV-GP antibody titres and 
      a gene signatures associated with reactogenicity (Geneva cohort) was identified 
      correlating gene expression profiles with an adverse event (ie, arthritis). 
      INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our results identify and cross-validate 
      immune-related transcriptomic signatures induced by rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination 
      in four cohorts of adult participants from different genetic and geographical 
      backgrounds. These signatures will aid in the rational development, testing, and 
      evaluation of novel vaccines and will allow evaluation of the effect of host 
      factors such as age, co-infection, and comorbidity on responses to vaccines.

TI  - Systems biology of immunity to MF59-adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted trivalent 
      seasonal influenza vaccines in early childhood.
PG  - 1853-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1519690113 [doi]
AB  - The dynamics and molecular mechanisms underlying vaccine immunity in early 
      childhood remain poorly understood. Here we applied systems approaches to 
      investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza 
      vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy 
      children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers 
      following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, 
      multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses 
      to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants 
      were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen 
      presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, 
      transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. 
      Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response 
      (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with 
      hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the 
      magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to 
      vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and 
      identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.

AB  - Malaria remains a global health challenge, necessitating the development of 
      effective vaccines. The RTS,S vaccination prevents Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) 
      malaria but is ineffective against Plasmodium vivax (Pv) disease. Herein, we 
      evaluated the murine immunogenicity of a recombinant PvCSP incorporating 
      prevalent polymorphisms, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or Poly I:C. Both 
      formulations induced prolonged IgG responses, with IgG1 dominance by the 
      Alhydrogel group and high titers of all IgG isotypes by the Poly I:C counterpart. 
      Poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccination increased splenic plasma cells, 
      terminally-differentiated memory cells (MBCs), and precursors relative to the 
      Alhydrogel-combined immunization. Splenic B-cells from Poly I:C-vaccinated mice 
      revealed an antibody-secreting cell- and MBC-differentiating gene expression 
      profile. Biological processes such as antibody folding and secretion were 
      highlighted by the Poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccination. These findings underscore the 
      potential of Poly I:C to strengthen immune responses against Pv malaria.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces the expansion of plasmablasts, which 
      produce antibodies that can neutralize DENV but also enhance disease upon 
      secondary infection with another DENV serotype. To understand how these immune 
      responses are generated, we used a systems biological approach to analyze immune 
      responses to dengue in humans. Transcriptomic analysis of whole blood revealed 
      that genes encoding proinflammatory mediators and type I interferon-related 
      proteins were associated with high DENV levels during initial symptomatic 
      disease. Additionally, CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes increased in the blood. 
      Similarly, in a nonhuman primate model, DENV infection boosted CD14(+)CD16(+) 
      monocyte numbers in the blood and lymph nodes. Upon DENV infection in vitro, 
      monocytes upregulated CD16 and mediated differentiation of resting B cells to 
      plasmablasts as well as immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM secretion. These findings 
      provide a detailed picture of innate responses to dengue and highlight a role for 
      CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes in promoting plasmablast differentiation and anti-DENV 
      antibody responses.

TI  - Phenotypical characterization of exteroceptive sensation and pain symptoms on 
      diabetic patients.
PG  - 724-738
LID - 10.1111/papr.13353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUD: Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of 
      diabetes, affecting about half of individuals with the disease. Among the various 
      symptoms of DN, the development of chronic pain stands out and manifests as 
      exacerbated responses to sensorial stimuli. The conventional clinical treatments 
      used for general neuropathy and associated painful symptoms, still brings 
      uncomplete and unsatisfactory pain relief. Patients with neuropathic pain 
      syndromes are heterogeneous. They present with a variety of sensory symptoms and 
      pain qualities which difficult the correct diagnosis of sensory comorbidities and 
      consequently, the appropriate chronic pain management. AIMS: Herein, we aimed to 
      demonstrate the existence of different sensory profiles on diabetic patients by 
      investigating epidemiological and clinical data on the symptomatology of a group 
      of patients with DN. METHODS: This is a longitudinal and observational study, 
      with a sample of 57 volunteers diagnosed with diabetes from outpatient day clinic 
      of Hospital Universitário of the University of São Paulo-Brazil. After being 
      invited and signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF), patients were submitted to 
      clinical evaluation and filled out pain and quality of life questionnaires. They 
      also performed quantitative sensory test (QST) and underwent skin biopsy for 
      correlation with cutaneous neuropathology. RESULTS: Data demonstrate that 70% of 
      the studied sample presented some type of pain, manifesting in a neuropathic or 
      nociceptive way, what has a negative impact on the life of patients with DM. We 
      also demonstrated a positive association between pain and anxiety and depression, 
      in addition to pain catastrophic thoughts. Three distinct profiles were 
      identified in the sample, separated according to the symptoms of pain: (i) 
      subjects without pain; (ii) with mild or moderate pain; (iii) subjects with 
      severe pain. We also identified through skin biopsy that diabetic patients 
      presented advanced sensory impairment, as a consequence of the degeneration of 
      the myelinated and unmyelinated peripheral fibers. This study characterized the 
      painful symptoms and exteroceptive sensation profile in these diabetic patients, 
      associated to a considerable level of sensory degeneration, indicating, and 
      reinforcing the importance of the long-term clinical monitoring of individuals 
      diagnosed with DM, regarding their symptom profiles and exteroceptive 
      sensitivity.

PG  - 1319-1327
LID - 10.1002/JLB.6MA0720-015RR [doi]
AB  - Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of inflammatory conditions of 
      unknown etiology whose incidence is sex dependent. Although several studies have 
      attempted to identify JIA-related gene signatures, none have systematically 
      assessed the impact of sex on the whole blood transcriptomes of JIA patients. By 
      analyzing over 400 unique pediatric gene expression profiles, we characterized 
      the sexual differences in leukocyte composition of systemic JIA patients and 
      identified sex-specific gene signatures that were related to immature 
      neutrophils. Female systemic JIA patients presented higher activation of immature 
      neutrophil-related genes compared to males, and these genes were associated with 
      the response to IL-1 receptor blockade treatment. Also, we found that this 
      immature neutrophil signature is sexually dimorphic across human lifespan and in 
      adults with rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. These results suggest that 
      neutrophil maturation is sexually dimorphic in rheumatic inflammation, and that 
      this may impact disease progression and treatment.

AB  - Unfortunately, there is a gap of understanding in the pathophysiology of chronic 
      liver disease due to the lack of experimental models that exactly mimic the human 
      disease. Additionally, the diagnosis of patients is very poor due to the lack of 
      biomarkers than can detect the disease in early stages. Thus, it is of utmost 
      interest the generation of a multidisciplinary consortium from different 
      countries with a direct translation. The present reports the meeting of the 2021 
      Iberoamerican Consortium for the study of liver Cirrhosis, held online, in 
      October 2021. The meeting, was focused on the recent advancements in the field of 
      chronic liver disease and cirrhosis with a specific focus on cell pathobiology 
      and liver regeneration, molecular and cellular targets involved in non-alcoholic 
      hepatic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), both ALD and western 
      diet, and end-stage liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, 
      the meeting highlighted recent advances in targeted novel technology (-omics) and 
      opening therapeutic avenues in this field of research.

TI  - HIV infection increases the risk of acquiring Plasmodium vivax malaria: a 4-year 
      cohort study in the Brazilian Amazon HIV and risk of vivax malaria.
PG  - 9076

AB  - Globally, malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both independently 
      associated with a massive burden of disease and death. While their co-infection 
      has been well studied for Plasmodium falciparum, scarce data exist regarding the 
      association of P. vivax and HIV. In this cohort study, we assessed the effect of 
      HIV on the risk of vivax malaria infection and recurrence during a 4-year 
      follow-up period in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon. For the purpose of 
      this study, we obtained clinical information from January 2012 to December 2016 
      from two databases. HIV screening data were acquired from the clinical 
      information system at the tropical hospital Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. 
      Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD). The National Malaria Surveillance database 
      (SIVEP malaria) was utilized to identify malaria infections during a 4-year 
      follow-up period after diagnosis of HIV. Both datasets were combined via data 
      linkage. Between 2012 and 2016, a total of 42,121 people were screened for HIV, 
      with 1569 testing positive (3.7%). Out of all the patients diagnosed with HIV, 
      198 had at least one episode of P. vivax malaria in the follow-up. In the 
      HIV-negative group, 711 participants had at least one P. vivax malaria episode. 
      When comparing both groups, HIV patients had a 6.48 [(5.37-7.83); P < 0.0001] 
      (adjusted relative risk) greater chance of acquiring P. vivax malaria. Moreover, 
      being of the male gender [ARR = 1.41 (1.17-1.71); P < 0.0001], Amerindian 
      ethnicity [ARR = 2.77 (1.46-5.28); P < 0.0001], and a resident in a municipality 
      of the Metropolitan region of Manaus [ARR = 1.48 (1.02-2.15); P = 0.038] were 
      independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of clinical malaria. 
      Education ≥ 8 years [ARR = 0.41 (0.26-0.64); P < 0.0001] and living in the urban 
      area [ARR = 0.44 (0.24-0.80); P = 0.007] were associated to a lower risk of P. 
      vivax malaria. A total of 28 (14.1%) and 180 (25.3%) recurrences (at least a 
      second clinical malaria episode) were reported in the HIV-positive and 
      HIV-negative groups, respectively. After adjusting for sex and education, 
      HIV-positive status was associated with a tendency towards protection from P. 
      vivax malaria recurrences [ARR = 0.55 (0.27-1.10); P = 0.090]. HIV status was not 
      associated with hospitalizations due to P. vivax malaria. CD4 + counts and viral 
      load were not associated with recurrences of P. vivax malaria. No significant 
      differences were found in the distribution of parasitemia between HIV-negative 
      and HIV-positive P. vivax malaria patients. Our results suggest that HIV-positive 
      status is a risk factor for vivax malaria infection, which represents an 
      additional challenge that should be addressed during elimination efforts.

AB  - Perineural invasion (PNI) is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
      (PDAC) associated with poor prognosis. Despite its clinical significance, the 
      specific cellular and molecular mechanisms driving PNI in PDAC remain poorly 
      defined. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data from approximately 60,000 
      single cells across 24 PDAC biopsy specimens to characterize the cellular 
      composition and signaling networks associated with PNI. We found that pancreatic 
      stellate cells (PSCs) expressing high levels of Periostin (POSTN), collagens, and 
      metalloproteinases are enriched in PNI-positive samples, suggesting an active 
      role in extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion. Spatial 
      transcriptomics revealed that these POSTN + PSCs are located adjacent to tumor 
      cells in invasive regions but are more distant in non-invasive samples. Invasive 
      tumors show a coordinated expression pattern involving ANXA1 in tumor cells, SPP1 
      and PLAU in PSCs, and their receptors in myeloid cells, supporting a signaling 
      axis that promotes perineural invasion. This spatial arrangement indicates that 
      POSTN + PSCs are not merely bystanders but active participants in driving tumor 
      infiltration and perineural dissemination. Together, these findings reveal 
      coordinated multicellular programs that underlie tumor invasion and spread in 
      PDAC, offering new insights into its aggressive biology.

AB  - A major challenge in vaccinology is to prospectively determine vaccine efficacy. 
      Here we have used a systems biology approach to identify early gene 'signatures' 
      that predicted immune responses in humans vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine 
      YF-17D. Vaccination induced genes that regulate virus innate sensing and type I 
      interferon production. Computational analyses identified a gene signature, 
      including complement protein C1qB and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 
      alpha kinase 4-an orchestrator of the integrated stress response-that correlated 
      with and predicted YF-17D CD8(+) T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an 
      independent, blinded trial. A distinct signature, including B cell growth factor 
      TNFRS17, predicted the neutralizing antibody response with up to 100% accuracy. 
      These data highlight the utility of systems biology approaches in predicting 
      vaccine efficacy.

TI  - Methotrexate promotes recovery of arthritis-induced alveolar bone loss and

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the shaping of the oral 
      and gut microbiome raises the question of whether and how RA treatment modifies 
      microbial communities. We examined changes in the oral and gut microbiota in a 
      mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) treated or not with methotrexate 
      (MTX). METHODS: Maxillae and stools were evaluated by the MiSeq platform of the 
      V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Alveolar bone parameters were analysed by 
      micro-computed tomography. Moreover, arthritis-induced changes in hyperalgesia 
      and oedema were assessed, along with the impact on periodontal bone health. 
      RESULTS: Microbial communities in MTX-treated AIA mice revealed distinct clusters 
      compared to the control and AIA groups. Overall, MTX impacted the richness and 
      variability of microorganisms in the oral-gut axis microbiome at the phylum 
      level. Regarding the oral microbiome, while in the control group the most 
      dominant phylum was Firmicutes, in the AIA group there was a shift towards the 
      predominance of Campilobacteriota and Bacteroidetes associated with the disease. 
      MTX treatment led to greater dominance of the health-associated phylum 
      Proteobacteria. In the gut microbiome, AIA induction resulted in increased 
      abundance of the Verrucomicrobiota phylum, and MTX treatment restored its levels 
      compared to control. Importantly, the MTX-treated AIA animals had significantly 
      less periodontal bone loss, as well as decreased hyperalgesia and joint oedema 
      compared to the AIA animals. CONCLUSION: Data suggest the benefit of MTX 
      treatment in protecting alveolar bone, in addition to providing new insights on 
      the drug-microbiome interaction in the course of RA.

AB  - The rapid evolution of influenza A viruses poses a great challenge to vaccine 
      development. Analytical and machine learning models have been applied to 
      facilitate the process of antigenicity determination. In this study, we designed 
      deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict Influenza antigenicity. Our 
      model is the first that systematically analyzed 566 amino acid properties and 141 
      amino acid substitution matrices for their predictability. We then optimized the 
      structure of the CNNs using particle swarm optimization. The optimal neural 
      networks outperform other predictive models with a blind validation accuracy of 
      95.8%. Further, we applied our model to vaccine recommendations in the period 
      1997 to 2011 and contrasted the performance of previous vaccine recommendations 
      using traditional experimental approaches. The results show that our model 
      outperforms the WHO recommendation and other existing models and could 
      potentially improve the vaccine recommendation process. Our results show that WHO 
      often selects virus strains with small variation from year to year and learns 
      slowly and recovers once coverage dips very low. In contrast, the influenza 
      strains selected via our CNN model can differ quite drastically from year to year 
      and exhibit consistently good coverage. In summary, we have designed a 
      comprehensive computational pipeline for optimizing a CNN in the modeling of 
      Influenza A antigenicity and vaccine recommendation. It is more cost and 
      time-effective when compared to traditional hemagglutination inhibition assay 
      analysis. The modeling framework is flexible and can be adopted to study other 
      type of viruses.

TI  - Toward an Integrated View of Operational Tolerance in Human Renal 
      Transplantation: A Systems Biology Perspective.
PG  - 379-403
LID - 10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2020035040 [doi]
AB  - Operational tolerance (OT) is the phenomenon occurring in human renal and liver 
      transplantation in which the body does not reject the organ after discontinuing 
      immunosuppression for at least a year. We revisited the data generated by The 
      Brazilian Multicenter Study on Operational Tolerance involving different 
      conceptual fields - antigen-specific cytokine response, immune cell numbers and 
      repertoire, signaling pathways, and epigenetics. We integrated our data to pave 
      the way to systems biology thinking and harness debate on potential mechanisms in 
      OT. We present original data on systems biology in OT, connecting potential 
      mechanistic players. Using bioinformatics, we identified three dominant features 
      that discriminate OT from its opposing clinical outcome, chronic rejection (CR). 
      The OT-CR discriminative molecules were FOXP3, GATA3 and STAT6, each 
      corresponding to a differential profile: (1) In FOXP3, OT presents preserved 
      regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers but decreased numbers in CR; (2) in GATA3, 
      increased expression is seen in OT; and (3) in STAT6, decreased monocyte 
      activation is seen in OT. With these variables, we built molecular networks to 
      identify interactions related to OT versus CR. Our first systems biology endeavor 
      gave rise to novel potentially relevant interconnected players in OT mechanisms: 
      FOXP3 connecting to interleukin-9 (IL-9) and IL-35 signaling, suggesting their 
      immunoregulatory involvement in OT. Likewise, GATA3/FOXP3 interactions 
      incrementing/stabilizing FOXP3 transcription suggest participation in keeping 
      healthy FOXP3+ Tregs in OT. We envision that systems biology thinking will 
      greatly contribute to advancing knowledge in human transplantation tolerance in 
      an interactive perspective.

TI  - Activation of beta-catenin in dendritic cells regulates immunity versus tolerance 
      in the intestine.
PG  - 849-53
LID - 10.1126/science.1188510 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) play a vital role in initiating robust immunity against 
      pathogens as well as maintaining immunological tolerance to self antigens. 
      However, the intracellular signaling networks that program DCs to become 
      tolerogenic remain unknown. We report here that the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling in 
      intestinal dendritic cells regulates the balance between inflammatory versus 
      regulatory responses in the gut. beta-catenin in intestinal dendritic cells was 
      required for the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators such as retinoic 
      acid-metabolizing enzymes, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-beta, 
      and the stimulation of regulatory T cell induction while suppressing inflammatory 
      effector T cells. Furthermore, ablation of beta-catenin expression in DCs 
      enhanced inflammatory responses and disease in a mouse model of inflammatory 
      bowel disease. Thus, beta-catenin signaling programs DCs to a tolerogenic state, 
      limiting the inflammatory response.

TI  - Molecular signatures of antibody responses derived from a systems biology study 
      of five human vaccines.
PG  - 195-204
LID - 10.1038/ni.2789 [doi]
AB  - Many vaccines induce protective immunity via antibodies. Systems biology 
      approaches have been used to determine signatures that can be used to predict 
      vaccine-induced immunity in humans, but whether there is a 'universal signature' 
      that can be used to predict antibody responses to any vaccine is unknown. Here we 
      did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate 
      vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of 
      published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To 
      achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available 
      human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological 
      contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules 
      revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different 
      classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein 
      recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early 
      transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and 
      demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.

AB  - Psychiatric and neurological disorders (PNDs) affect millions worldwide and only 
      a few drugs achieve complete therapeutic success in the treatment of these 
      disorders. Due to the high cost of developing novel drugs, drug repositioning 
      represents a promising alternative method of treatment. In this manuscript, we 
      used a network medicine approach to investigate the molecular characteristics of 
      PNDs and identify novel drug candidates for repositioning. Using IBM Watson for 
      Drug Discovery, a powerful machine learning text-mining application, we built 
      knowledge networks containing connections between PNDs and genes or drugs 
      mentioned in the scientific literature published in the past 50 years. This 
      approach revealed several drugs that target key PND-related genes, which have 
      never been used to treat these disorders to date. We validate our framework by 
      detecting drugs that have been undergoing clinical trial for treating some of the 
      PNDs, but have no published results in their support. Our data provides 
      comprehensive insights into the molecular pathology of PNDs and offers promising 
      drug repositioning candidates for follow-up trials.

PG  - e0004086

LID - e0004086
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis relies on a single 
      drug, praziquantel (PZQ), and the selection of resistant worms under repeated 
      treatment is a concern. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the 
      molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or 
      synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. METHODOLOGY: We used a custom-designed 
      Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal 
      doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and 
      unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) 
      or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro 
      assay. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ 
      in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression 
      patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), 
      indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also 
      identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. 
      Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite 
      genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for 
      proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different 
      drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed 
      proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and 
      tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm 
      mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a 
      synergistic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Functional analysis of gene interaction networks 
      is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug 
      candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in 
      combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult 
      worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it begins with a 
      short acute phase characterized by high parasitemia followed by a life-long 
      chronic phase with scarce parasitism. Cardiac involvement is the most prominent 
      manifestation, as 30% of infected subjects will develop abnormal ventricular 
      repolarization with myocarditis, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by 
      undefined mechanisms. Nevertheless, follow-up studies in chagasic patients, as 
      well as studies with murine models, suggest that the intensity of clinical 
      symptoms and pathophysiological events that occur during the acute phase of 
      disease are associated with the severity of cardiac disease observed during the 
      chronic phase. In the present study we investigated the role of microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) in the disease progression in response to T. cruzi infection, as 
      alterations in miRNA levels are known to be associated with many cardiovascular 
      disorders. We screened 641 rodent miRNAs in heart samples of mice during an acute 
      infection with the Colombiana T.cruzi strain and identified multiple miRNAs 
      significantly altered upon infection. Seventeen miRNAs were found significantly 
      deregulated in all three analyzed time points post infection. Among these, six 
      miRNAs had their expression correlated with clinical parameters relevant to the 
      disease, such as parasitemia and maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. 
      Computational analyses identified that the gene targets for these six miRNAs were 
      involved in networks and signaling pathways related to increased ventricular 
      depolarization and repolarization times, important factors for QTc interval 
      prolongation. The data presented here will guide further studies about the 
      contribution of microRNAs to Chagas heart disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Gene Signatures of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Clinical-Immunological Profiles 
      of Human Infection by Leishmania (L.) chagasi in Amazonian Brazil.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11030653 [doi]
LID - 653
AB  - Individuals infected with Leishmania (L.) chagasi may present different 
      asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of infection, which vary in the 
      clinical-immunological profiles that can be classified as asymptomatic infection 
      (AI), subclinical resistant infection (SRI), indeterminate initial infection 
      (III), subclinical oligosymptomatic infection (SOI), and symptomatic infection 
      (SI) (=American visceral leishmaniasis, AVL). However, little is known about the 
      molecular differences between individuals having each profile. Here, we performed 
      whole-blood transcriptomic analyses of 56 infected individuals from Pará State 
      (Brazilian Amazon), covering all five profiles. We then identified the gene 
      signatures of each profile by comparing their transcriptome with those of 11 
      healthy individuals from the same area. Symptomatic individuals with SI (=AVL) 
      and SOI profiles showed higher transcriptome perturbation when compared to those 
      asymptomatic III, AI and SRI profiles, suggesting that disease severity may be 
      associated with greater transcriptomic changes. Although the expression of many 
      genes was altered on each profile, very few genes were shared among the profiles. 
      This indicated that each profile has a unique gene signature. The innate immune 
      system pathway was strongly activated only in asymptomatic AI and SRI profiles, 
      suggesting the control of infection. In turn, pathways such as MHC Class II 
      antigen presentation and NF-kB activation in B cells seemed to be specifically 
      induced in symptomatic SI (=AVL) and SOI profiles. Moreover, cellular response to 
      starvation was down-regulated in those symptomatic profiles. Overall, this study 
      revealed five distinct transcriptional patterns associated to the 
      clinical-immunological (symptomatic and asymptomatic) profiles of human L. (L.) 
      chagasi-infection in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Antigen-specific B cells bifurcate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and 
      memory B cells (MBCs) after infection or vaccination. ASCs (plasmablasts) have 
      been extensively studied in humans, but less is known about B cells that become 
      activated but do not differentiate into plasmablasts. Here we have defined the 
      phenotype and transcriptional program of a subset of antigen-specific B cells, 
      which we have called 'activated B cells' (ABCs), that were distinct from ASCs and 
      were committed to the MBC lineage. We detected ABCs in humans after infection 
      with Ebola virus or influenza virus and also after vaccination. By simultaneously 
      analyzing antigen-specific ASCs and ABCs in human blood after vaccination against 
      influenza virus, we investigated the clonal overlap and extent of somatic 
      hypermutation (SHM) in the ASC (effector) and ABC (memory) lineages. Longitudinal 
      tracking of vaccination-induced hemagglutinin (HA)-specific clones revealed no 
      overall increase in SHM over time, which suggested that repeated annual 
      immunization might have limitations in enhancing the quality of 
      influenza-virus-specific antibody.

AB  - The recent epidemic of the arthritogenic alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) 
      has prompted a quest to understand the correlates of protection against virus and 
      disease in order to inform development of new interventions. Herein we highlight 
      the propensity of CHIKV infections to persist long term, both as persistent, 
      steady-state, viraemias in multiple B cell deficient mouse strains, and as 
      persistent RNA (including negative-strand RNA) in wild-type mice. The knockout 
      mouse studies provided evidence for a role for T cells (but not NK cells) in 
      viraemia suppression, and confirmed the role of T cells in arthritis promotion, 
      with vaccine-induced T cells also shown to be arthritogenic in the absence of 
      antibody responses. However, MHC class II-restricted T cells were not required 
      for production of anti-viral IgG2c responses post CHIKV infection. The anti-viral 
      cytokines, TNF and IFNγ, were persistently elevated in persistently infected B 
      and T cell deficient mice, with adoptive transfer of anti-CHIKV antibodies unable 
      to clear permanently the viraemia from these, or B cell deficient, mice. The NOD 
      background increased viraemia and promoted arthritis, with B, T and NK deficient 
      NOD mice showing high-levels of persistent viraemia and ultimately succumbing to 
      encephalitic disease. In wild-type mice persistent CHIKV RNA and negative strand 
      RNA (detected for up to 100 days post infection) was associated with persistence 
      of cellular infiltrates, CHIKV antigen and stimulation of IFNα/β and T cell 
      responses. These studies highlight that, secondary to antibodies, several factors 
      are involved in virus control, and suggest that chronic arthritic disease is a 
      consequence of persistent, replicating and transcriptionally active CHIKV RNA.

AB  - We determined the effects of DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation on gene 
      expression in Leptospira interrogans using DNA microarrays. These data were 
      integrated with DNA binding in vivo of LexA1, a regulator of the DNA damage 
      response, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel DNA 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq). In response to DNA damage, Leptospira induced expression 
      of genes involved in DNA metabolism, in mobile genetic elements and defective 
      prophages. The DNA repair genes involved in removal of photo-damage (e.g. 
      nucleotide excision repair uvrABC, recombinases recBCD and resolvases ruvABC) 
      were not induced. Genes involved in various metabolic pathways were down 
      regulated, including genes involved in cell growth, RNA metabolism and the 
      tricarboxylic acid cycle. From ChIP-seq data, we observed 24 LexA1 binding sites 
      located throughout chromosome 1 and one binding site in chromosome 2. Expression 
      of many, but not all, genes near those sites was increased following DNA damage. 
      Binding sites were found as far as 550 bp upstream from the start codon, or 1 kb 
      into the coding sequence. Our findings indicate that there is a shift in gene 
      expression following DNA damage that represses genes involved in cell growth and 
      virulence, and induces genes involved in mutagenesis and recombination.

TI  - Prior upregulation of interferon pathways in the nasopharynx impacts viral 
      shedding following live attenuated influenza vaccine challenge in children.
PG  - 100465
LID - 10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100465 [doi]
LID - 100465
AB  - In children lacking influenza-specific adaptive immunity, upper respiratory tract 
      innate immune responses may influence viral replication and disease outcome. We 
      use trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate challenge 
      model in children aged 24-59 months to identify pre-infection mucosal 
      transcriptomic signatures associated with subsequent viral shedding. Upregulation 
      of interferon signaling pathways prior to LAIV is significantly associated with 
      lower strain-specific viral loads (VLs) at days 2 and 7. Several 
      interferon-stimulated genes are differentially expressed in children with 
      pre-LAIV asymptomatic respiratory viral infections and negatively correlated with 
      LAIV VLs. Upregulation of genes enriched in macrophages, neutrophils, and 
      eosinophils is associated with lower VLs and found more commonly in children with 
      asymptomatic viral infections. Variability in pre-infection mucosal interferon 
      gene expression in children may impact the course of subsequent influenza 
      infections. This variability may be due to frequent respiratory viral infections, 
      demonstrating the potential importance of mucosal virus-virus interactions in 
      children.

      units of rVSV-ZEBOV in the WHO-coordinated trials of 2014-2015 were followed for 
      up to 4 (Lambaréné, Gabon) and 5 (Geneva, Switzerland) years. We report 
      seropositivity rates, geometric mean titres (GMTs), and population distribution 
      of ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus and 
      live-virus neutralization) and antibody avidity; the primary outcome was ZEBOV-GP 
      ELISA IgG GMTs at 4 or 5 years compared with 1 year (Y1) after immunization. 
      RESULTS: Among the 168 eligible vaccinees (Geneva: 97 and Lambaréné: 71) enrolled 
      1 year post-immunization, 146 (87%) remained enrolled at 4 years (Geneva: n = 88, 
      Lambaréné: n = 58), and 84 (87%, Geneva) at 5 years post-vaccination. ZEBOV-GP 
      ELISA IgG GMTs plateaued, with no declining trend from 1 year through the last 
      time point assessed (1147.8 [95% CI 874.3-1507.0] at Y1 versus 1548.1 [95% CI 
      1136.6-2108.5] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers receiving ≥10 million plaque-forming 
      units of rVSV-ZEBOV), their avidity matching that of ZEBOV convalescents. 
      Live-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected for shorter periods and in fewer 
      vaccinees (53/95 [56%] at Y1 versus 35/84 [42%] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers, all 
      dose levels). DISCUSSION: Titres at Y1 emerged as a correlate of antibody 
      persistence at Y5. The findings of persistent ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG titres yet 
      shorter-lasting, lower titres of live-virus neutralizing antibodies suggest the 
      contribution of antibody-mediated protective mechanisms other than 
      neutralization. Long-term clinical efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV, however, requires 
      further study.

AB  - The rVSV-ZEBOV Ebolavirus vaccine confers protection within days after 
      immunization, suggesting the contribution of innate immune responses. We report 
      modulation of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccinee blood CD56(+) NK cell numbers, NKG2D or NKp30 
      surface receptor expression, Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR)(+) cell 
      percentages and NK-cell-related genes on day 1 post immunization. Inverse 
      correlations existed between the concentration of several plasma cytokines and 
      inhibitory KIR(+) CD56(dim) or cytokine-responsive CD56(bright) NK cells. Thus, 
      NK cells may contribute to the early protective efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV in humans.

TI  - Acute Zika Virus Infection in an Endemic Area Shows Modest Proinflammatory 
      Systemic Immunoactivation and Cytokine-Symptom Associations.
PG  - 821
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00821 [doi]
LID - 821
AB  - An early immune response to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection may determine its 
      clinical manifestation and outcome, including neurological effects. However, 
      low-grade and transient viremia limits the prompt diagnosis of acute ZIKV 
      infection. We have investigated the plasma cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor 
      profiles of 36 individuals from an endemic area displaying different symptoms 
      such as exanthema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, hyperemia, swelling, 
      itching, and nausea during early-phase infection. These profiles were then 
      associated with symptoms, revealing important aspects of the 
      immunopathophysiology of ZIKV infection. The levels of some cytokines/chemokines 
      were significantly higher in acute ZIKV-infected individuals compared to healthy 
      donors, including interferon (IFN) gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), regulated on 
      activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-γ, interleukin 
      (IL)-9, IL-7, IL-5, and IL-1ra, including some with predominantly 
      immunoregulatory activity. Of note, we found that higher levels of IP-10 and IL-5 
      in ZIKV-infected individuals were strongly associated with exanthema and 
      headache, respectively. Also, higher levels of IL-1ra were associated with 
      subjects with arthralgia, whereas those with fever showed lower levels of 
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). No correlation was observed 
      between the number of symptoms and ZIKV viral load. Interestingly, only IP-10 
      showed significantly decreased levels in the recovery phase. In conclusion, our 
      results indicate that acute ZIKV infection in a larger cohort resident to an 
      endemic area displays a modest systemic immune activation profile, involving both 
      proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines that could 
      participate of virus control. In addition, we showed that differential 
      cytokine/chemokine levels are related to specific clinical symptoms, suggesting 
      their participation in underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Molecular Insights into Cell-Mediated Immunity in Atypical Non-Ulcerated 
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13020413 [doi]
LID - 413
AB  - Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infections range from asymptomatic (AS) 
      to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). One of the manifestations is an atypical 
      non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of 
      Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of 
      cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from 
      Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation 
      of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in 
      NUCL involved in CD8(+) T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species 
      generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement 
      receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL 
      by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T 
      lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and 
      down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated 
      DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, 
      down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome 
      findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin 
      lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS 
      and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the 
      benign nature of the NUCL.

AB  - It has been postulated that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the 
      posttranscriptional control of gene expression, and may have contributed to the 
      emergence of the complex attributes observed in mammalians. We show here that the 
      complement of ncRNAs expressed from intronic regions of the human and mouse 
      genomes comprises at least 78,147 and 39,660 transcriptional units, respectively. 
      To identify conserved intronic sequences expressed in both humans and mice, we 
      used custom-designed human cDNA microarrays to separately interrogate RNA from 
      mouse and human liver, kidney, and prostate tissues. An overlapping tissue 
      expression signature was detected for both species, comprising 198 transcripts; 
      among these, 22 RNAs map to intronic regions with evidence of evolutionary 
      conservation in humans and mice. Transcription of selected human-mouse intronic 
      ncRNAs was confirmed using strand-specific RT-PCR. Altogether, these results 
      support an evolutionarily conserved role of intronic ncRNAs in human and mouse, 
      which are likely to be involved in the fine tuning of gene expression regulation 
      in different mammalian tissues.

AB  - The Plasmodium cell cycle, wherein millions of parasites differentiate and 
      proliferate, occurs in synchrony with the vertebrate host's circadian cycle. The 
      underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we addressed this question in a mouse 
      model of Plasmodium chabaudi infection. Inflammatory gene expression and 
      carbohydrate metabolism are both enhanced in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-primed 
      leukocytes and liver cells from P. chabaudi-infected mice. Tumor necrosis factor 
      α (TNFα) expression oscillates across the host circadian cycle, and increased 
      TNFα correlates with hypoglycemia and a higher frequency of non-replicative ring 
      forms of trophozoites. Conversely, parasites proliferate and acquire biomass 
      during food intake by the host. Importantly, cyclic hypoglycemia is attenuated 
      and synchronization of P. chabaudi stages is disrupted in IFNγ(-/-), TNF 
      receptor(-/-), or diabetic mice. Hence, the daily rhythm of systemic TNFα 
      production and host food intake set the pace for Plasmodium synchronization with 
      the host's circadian cycle. This mechanism indicates that Plasmodium parasites 
      take advantage of the host's feeding habits.

      controlling the magnitude of neonatal germinal center (GC) reactions and primary 
      vaccine antibody responses. We compared the functional attributes of neonatal and 
      adult T(fh) cells at the transcriptomic level and demonstrated that the T(fh) 
      cell program is well-initiated in neonates although the T(fh) gene-expression 
      pattern (i.e., CXCR5, IL-21, BCL6, TBK1, STAT4, ASCL2, and c-MAF) is largely 
      underrepresented as compared to adult T(fh) cells. Importantly, we identified a 
      TH2-bias of neonatal T(fh) cells, with preferential differentiation toward 
      short-lived pre-T(fh) effector cells. Remarkably, adjuvantation with CpG-ODNs 
      redirect neonatal pre-T(fh) cells toward committed GC-T(fh) cells, as illustrated 
      by increased expression of T(fh) signature genes and reduced expression of 
      TH2-related genes.

PG  - 543-7

AB  - Many successful vaccines induce persistent antibody responses that can last a 
      lifetime. The mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear, but emerging 
      evidence indicates that they activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors 
      (TLRs). For example, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful 
      empiric vaccines ever developed, activates dendritic cells via multiple TLRs to 
      stimulate proinflammatory cytokines. Triggering specific combinations of TLRs in 
      dendritic cells can induce synergistic production of cytokines, which results in 
      enhanced T-cell responses, but its impact on antibody responses remain unknown. 
      Learning the critical parameters of innate immunity that program such antibody 
      responses remains a major challenge in vaccinology. Here we demonstrate that 
      immunization of mice with synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus 
      ligands that signal through TLR4 and TLR7 induces synergistic increases in 
      antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with 
      nanoparticles containing antigens plus a single TLR ligand. Consistent with this 
      there was enhanced persistence of germinal centres and of plasma-cell responses, 
      which persisted in the lymph nodes for >1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no 
      enhancement of the early short-lived plasma-cell response relative to that 
      observed with single TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells, 
      isolated 7 days after immunization, indicated that there was early programming 
      towards B-cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of 
      both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells, as well as on T-cell help. Immunization 
      protected completely against lethal avian and swine influenza virus strains in 
      mice, and induced robust immunity against pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus 
      macaques.

TI  - Total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia is associated with 
      endothelial and haematological perturbations in Plasmodium vivax patients.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.71351 [doi]
LID - e71351
AB  - Plasmodium vivax is the major cause of human malaria in the Americas. How P. 
      vivax infection can lead to poor clinical outcomes, despite low peripheral 
      parasitaemia, remains a matter of intense debate. Estimation of total P. vivax 
      biomass based on circulating markers indicates existence of a predominant 
      parasite population outside of circulation. In this study, we investigate 
      associations between both peripheral and total parasite biomass and host response 
      in vivax malaria. We analysed parasite and host signatures in a cohort of 
      uncomplicated vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Brazil, combining clinical and 
      parasite parameters, multiplexed analysis of host responses, and ex vivo assays. 
      Patterns of clinical features, parasite burden, and host signatures measured in 
      plasma across the patient cohort were highly heterogenous. Further data 
      deconvolution revealed two patient clusters, here termed Vivax(low) and 
      Vivax(high). These patient subgroups were defined based on differences in total 
      parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. Overall Vivax(low) patients 
      clustered with healthy donors and Vivax(high) patients showed more profound 
      alterations in haematological parameters, endothelial cell (EC) activation, and 
      glycocalyx breakdown and levels of cytokines regulating different haematopoiesis 
      pathways compared to Vivax(low). Vivax(high) patients presented more severe 
      thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, along with enrichment of neutrophils in the 
      peripheral blood and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLCR). When 
      patients' signatures were combined, high association of total parasite biomass 
      with a subset of markers of EC activation, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia 
      severity was observed. Finally, machine learning models defined a combination of 
      host parameters measured in the circulation that could predict the extent of 
      parasite infection outside of circulation. Altogether, our data show that total 
      parasite biomass is a better predictor of perturbations in host homeostasis in P. 
      vivax patients than peripheral parasitaemia. This supports the emerging paradigm 
      of a P. vivax tissue reservoir, particularly in the haematopoietic niche of bone 
      marrow and spleen.

AB  - The influenza is a common viral infection that can be fatal, especially in 
      high-risk groups such as children, pregnant women, elderly, and immune-deficient 
      individuals. Vaccination is the most efficient approach to prevent the spreading 
      of viral infection and promote individual and public health. In contrast, 
      exposure to environmental pollutants such as cigarette smoke reduces the efficacy 
      of vaccination. We investigated whether chronic exposure to hydroquinone (HQ), 
      the most abundant compound of the tobacco particulate phase, could impair the 
      adaptive immune responses elicited by influenza vaccination. For this, adult male 
      C57BL/6 mice were daily exposed to either nebulized HQ or PBS for 1 h for a total 
      of eight weeks. At weeks 6 and 8, the mice were primed and boosted with the 
      trivalent influenza vaccine via IM respectively. Although the HQ exposure did not 
      alter the body weight of the mice and the biochemical and hematological 
      parameters, the pollutant increased the oxidative stress in splenocytes of 
      immunized animals, modified the morphology of spleen follicles, and augmented the 
      size of their lymph nodes. The lymphoid organs of HQ-exposed mice presented a 
      similar number of vaccine-specific IgG-secreting cells, titers of 
      vaccine-specific total IgG, and respective subclasses. Transcriptome studies with 
      HQ, benzene, or cigarette smoke exposure were also analyzed. The genes 
      up-regulated upon pollutant exposure were associated with neutrophil migration 
      and were shown to be co-expressed with antibody-secreting cell genes. Therefore, 
      these findings suggest that HQ exposure may trigger an immune-compensatory 
      mechanism that enhances the humoral responses induced by influenza vaccination.

TI  - Variants in the Kisspeptin-GnRH Pathway Modulate the Hormonal Profile and 
      Reproductive Outcomes.
PG  - 1012-1022
LID - 10.1089/dna.2019.5165 [doi]
AB  - Kisspeptin has been identified as a key regulatory protein in the release of 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently increases gonadotropin 
      secretion during puberty to establish reproductive function and regulate the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The effects of variants in the KISS1, 
      KISS1R, and GNRHR genes and their possible association with assisted reproduction 
      outcomes remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used next-generation 
      sequencing to investigate the associations of the genetic diversity at the 
      candidate loci for KISS1, KISS1R, and GNRHR with the hormonal profiles and 
      reproductive outcomes in 86 women who underwent in vitro fertilization 
      treatments. Variants in the KISS1 and KISS1R genes were associated with 
      luteinizing hormone (rs35431622:T>C), anti-Mullerian hormone (rs71745629delT), 
      follicle-stimulating hormone (rs73507529:C>A), and estradiol (rs73507527:G>A, 
      rs350130:A>G, and rs73507529:C>A) levels, as well as with reproductive outcomes 
      such as the number of oocytes retrieved (s35431622:T>C), metaphasis II oocytes 
      (rs35431622:T>C), and embryos (rs1132506:G>C). Additionally, variants in the 
      GNRHR UTR3' (rs1038426:C>A, rs12508464:A>C, rs13150734:C>A, rs17635850:A>G, 
      rs35683646:G>A, rs35610027:C>G, rs35845954:T>C, rs17635749:C>T, and 
      rs7666201:C>T) were associated with low prolactin levels. A conjoint analysis of 
      clinical, hormonal, and genetic variables using a generalized linear model 
      identified two variants of the KISS1 gene (rs71745629delT and rs1132506:G>C) that 
      were significantly associated with hormonal variations and reproductive outcomes. 
      The findings suggest that variants in KISS1, KISS1R, and GNRHR genes can modulate 
      hormone levels and reproductive outcomes.

TI  - Systems Analysis of Immunity to Influenza Vaccination across Multiple Years and

AB  - Systems approaches have been used to describe molecular signatures driving 
      immunity to influenza vaccination in humans. Whether such signatures are similar 
      across multiple seasons and in diverse populations is unknown. We applied systems 
      approaches to study immune responses in young, elderly, and diabetic subjects 
      vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine across five consecutive seasons. 
      Signatures of innate immunity and plasmablasts correlated with and predicted 
      influenza antibody titers at 1 month after vaccination with >80% accuracy across 
      multiple seasons but were not associated with the longevity of the response. 
      Baseline signatures of lymphocyte and monocyte inflammation were positively and 
      negatively correlated, respectively, with antibody responses at 1 month. Finally, 
      integrative analysis of microRNAs and transcriptomic profiling revealed potential 
      regulators of vaccine immunity. These results identify shared vaccine-induced 
      signatures across multiple seasons and in diverse populations and might help 
      guide the development of next-generation vaccines that provide persistent 
      immunity against influenza.

TI  - RASL11A, member of a novel small monomeric GTPase gene family, is down-regulated 
      in prostate tumors.
PG  - 618-27
AB  - We performed a genome-wide search for novel loci encoding for Ras-related 
      proteins based on the genome mapping coordinates of the cancer-derived EST 
      dataset at GenBank. Partial sequences from two novel human genes were identified 
      and subsequently used for full length transcript cloning. RASL11A and ARL9 belong 
      to two novel subfamilies coding for small GTPases that we found to be highly 
      conserved among eukaryotes. The Arl9/Arl10 subfamily displays a conserved 
      interswitch toggle that places it evolutionarily closer to the Arf family. Rasl11 
      proteins are more closely related to the Ras branch of GTPases. All orthologues 
      newly identified here exhibit an Asn residue in place of the highly conserved 
      Thr35 of the G domain, suggesting that the universal switch mechanism of small 
      GTPases may be structurally different in this subfamily. We determined by 
      Northern blot that RASL11A is transcribed in several human tissues and that it is 
      down-regulated in prostate tumors as measured by quantitative real-time PCR. 
      These results highlight a previously uncharacterized subfamily of Ras-related 
      genes that may have a tumor suppressor role in prostate cancer.

TI  - Distinct TLR adjuvants differentially stimulate systemic and local innate immune 
      responses in nonhuman primates.
PG  - 2044-55
LID - 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388579 [doi]
AB  - TLR ligands (TLR-Ls) represent novel vaccine adjuvants, but their immunologic 
      effects in humans remain poorly defined in vivo. In the present study, we 
      analyzed the innate responses stimulated by different TLR-Ls in rhesus macaques. 
      MPL (TLR4-L), R-848 (TLR7/8-L), or cytosine-phosphate-guanine 
      oligodeoxynucleotide (TLR9-L) induced a rapid and robust expansion of blood 
      neutrophils, with a concomitant reduction in PBMCs. Furthermore, all TLR-Ls 
      induced rapid (3-8 hours) expansion of CD14(+) monocytes, but only TLR7/8-L and 
      TLR9-L mobilized the CD14(+)CD16(+) and CD14(dim)CD16(++) monocytes, and only 
      TLR7/8-L and TLR9-L induced activation of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and 
      plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), production of IP-10 and type-I IFN, and expression of 
      type-I IFN-related and chemokine genes in the blood. In the draining lymph nodes 
      (LNs), consistent with the effects in blood, all TLR-Ls induced expansion of 
      CD14(+) monocytes, but only TLR7/8-L and TLR9-L expanded the activated 
      CD14(+)CD16(+) cells. TLR4-L and TLR9-L differentially induced the expansion of 
      mDCs and pDCs (1-3 days), but did not activate DCs. In contrast, TLR7/8-L did not 
      induce DC expansion, but did activate mDCs. Finally, both TLR9-L and TLR7/8-L 
      induced the expression of genes related to chemokines and type-I IFNs in LNs. 
      Thus different TLR-Ls mediate distinct signatures of early innate responses both 
      locally and systemically.

TI  - Antisense intronic non-coding RNA levels correlate to the degree of tumor 
      differentiation in prostate cancer.
PG  - 6684-92
AB  - A large fraction of transcripts are expressed antisense to introns of known genes 
      in the human genome. Here we show the construction and use of a cDNA microarray 
      platform enriched in intronic transcripts to assess their biological relevance in 
      pathological conditions. To validate the approach, prostate cancer was used as a 
      model, and 27 patient tumor samples with Gleason scores ranging from 5 to 10 were 
      analyzed. We find that a considerably higher fraction (6.6%, [23/346]) of 
      intronic transcripts are significantly correlated (P< or =0.001) to the degree of 
      prostate tumor differentiation (Gleason score) when compared to transcripts from 
      unannotated genomic regions (1%, [6/539]) or from exons of known genes (2%, 
      [27/1369]). Among the top twelve transcripts most correlated to tumor 
      differentiation, six are antisense intronic messages as shown by 
      orientation-specific RT-PCR or Northern blot analysis with strand-specific 
      riboprobe. Orientation-specific real-time RT-PCR with six tumor samples, 
      confirmed the correlation (P=0.024) between the low/high degrees of tumor 
      differentiation and antisense intronic RASSF1 transcript levels. The need to use 
      intron arrays to reveal the transcriptome profile of antisense intronic RNA in 
      cancer has clearly emerged.

TI  - Splice variants of TLE family genes and up-regulation of a TLE3 isoform in 
      prostate tumors.
PG  - 918-23
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.097 [doi]
AB  - The TLE genes constitute a family of important transcriptional co-repressors 
      involved in many cellular processes. We found evidence of alternatively spliced 
      mRNAs for human TLE1-4 containing premature stop codons, thus encoding putative 
      shortened proteins. Microarray experiments and Real-time RT-PCR assays showed 
      that alternatively spliced isoforms of TLE1, TLE2 an d TLE3 were preferentially 
      expressed in prostate in comparison to liver and kidney tissues. We identified by 
      orientation-specific R T-PCR an antisense partially intronic non-coding RNA that 
      overlaps a novel exon of the TLE3 gene, raising the possibility of regulation of 
      alternative splicing by this non-coding transcript. The alternatively spliced 
      isoform of TLE3 was up-regulated (6- to 17-fo ld) in prostate tumors in 
      comparison to matched non-tumor adjacent tissue from 7 out of 11 (64%) patients 
      and in four prostate tumor cell lines in comparison to a normal prostate cell 
      line. These results demonstrate that different isoforms of TLE genes are commonly 
      transcribed in human tissues and suggest that TLE3 could be involved in prostate 
      cancer development.

TI  - SerpinB2 Deficiency Results in a Stratum Corneum Defect and Increased Sensitivity

AB  - SerpinB2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2) is constitutively expressed at 
      high levels by differentiating keratinocytes in mice and humans; however, the 
      physiological function of keratinocyte SerpinB2 remains unclear. Herein, we show 
      that SerpinB2(-/-) mice are more susceptible to contact dermatitis after topical 
      application of dinitrofluorobenzene, and show enhanced inflammatory lesions after 
      topical applications of phorbol ester. Untreated SerpinB2(-/-) mice showed no 
      overt changes in epithelial structure, and we were unable to find evidence for a 
      role for keratinocyte SerpinB2 in regulating immunity, apoptosis, IL-1β 
      production, proteasomal activity, or wound healing. Instead, the phenotype was 
      associated with impaired skin barrier function and a defective stratum corneum, 
      with SerpinB2(-/-) mice showing increased transepidermal water loss, increased 
      overt loss of stratum corneum in inflammatory lesions, and impaired stratum 
      corneum thickening after phorbol ester treatment. Immunoblotting suggested that 
      SerpinB2 (cross-linked into the cornified envelope) is present in the stratum 
      corneum and retains the ability to form covalent inhibitory complexes with 
      urokinase. Data suggest that the function of keratinocyte SerpinB2 is protection 
      of the stratum corneum from proteolysis via inhibition of urokinase, thereby 
      maintaining the integrity and barrier function of the stratum corneum, 
      particularly during times of skin inflammation. Implications for studies 
      involving genetically modified mice treated with topical agents and 
      human dermatological conditions, such as contact dermatitis, are discussed.

TI  - The T helper type 2 response to cysteine proteases requires dendritic 
      cell-basophil cooperation via ROS-mediated signaling.
PG  - 608-17
LID - 10.1038/ni.1883 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms that initiate T helper type 2 (T(H)2) responses are poorly 
      understood. Here we demonstrate that cysteine protease-induced T(H)2 responses 
      occur via 'cooperation' between migratory dermal dendritic cells (DCs) and 
      basophils positive for interleukin 4 (IL-4). Subcutaneous immunization with 
      papain plus antigen induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymph node DCs and 
      in dermal DCs and epithelial cells of the skin. ROS orchestrated T(H)2 responses 
      by inducing oxidized lipids that triggered the induction of thymic stromal 
      lymphopoietin (TSLP) by epithelial cells mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
      and the adaptor protein TRIF; by suppressing production of the T(H)1-inducing 
      molecules IL-12 and CD70 in lymph node DCs; and by inducing the DC-derived 
      chemokine CCL7, which mediated recruitment of IL-4(+) basophils to the lymph 
      node. Thus, the T(H)2 response to cysteine proteases requires DC-basophil 
      cooperation via ROS-mediated signaling.

TI  - Insight Into the Long Noncoding RNA and mRNA Coexpression Profile in the Human

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne infectious disease that can be 
      potentially fatal if left untreated. In Brazil, it is caused by Leishmania 
      infantum parasites. Blood transcriptomics allows us to assess the molecular 
      mechanisms involved in the immunopathological processes of several clinical 
      conditions, namely, parasitic diseases. Here, we performed mRNA sequencing of 
      peripheral blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis during the active 
      phase of the disease and six months after successful treatment, when the patients 
      were considered clinically cured. To strengthen the study, the RNA-seq data 
      analysis included two other non-diseased groups composed of healthy uninfected 
      volunteers and asymptomatic individuals. We identified thousands of 
      differentially expressed genes between VL patients and non-diseased groups. 
      Overall, pathway analysis corroborated the importance of signaling involving 
      interferons, chemokines, Toll-like receptors and the neutrophil response. 
      Cellular deconvolution of gene expression profiles was able to discriminate 
      cellular subtypes, highlighting the contribution of plasma cells and NK cells in 
      the course of the disease. Beyond the biological processes involved in the 
      immunopathology of VL revealed by the expression of protein coding genes (PCGs), 
      we observed a significant participation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in our 
      blood transcriptome dataset. Genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs expression in VL has 
      never been performed. lncRNAs have been considered key regulators of disease 
      progression, mainly in cancers; however, their pattern regulation may also help 
      to understand the complexity and heterogeneity of host immune responses elicited 
      by L. infantum infections in humans. Among our findings, we identified lncRNAs 
      such as IL21-AS1, MIR4435-2HG and LINC01501 and coexpressed lncRNA/mRNA pairs 
      such as CA3-AS1/CA1, GASAL1/IFNG and LINC01127/IL1R1-IL1R2. Thus, for the first 
      time, we present an integrated analysis of PCGs and lncRNAs by exploring the 
      lncRNA-mRNA coexpression profile of VL to provide insights into the regulatory 
      gene network involved in the development of this inflammatory and infectious 
      disease.

TI  - Down-regulation of 14q32-encoded miRNAs and tumor suppressor role for miR-654-3p 
      in papillary thyroid cancer.
PG  - 9597-9607
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.14162 [doi]
AB  - Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most prevalent malignant neoplasia of 
      the thyroid gland. A fraction of PTC cases show loss of differentiation and 
      aggressive behavior, with radioiodine therapy resistance and metastasis. Although 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) emerged as promising molecular markers for PTC, their role in 
      the loss of differentiation observed during PTC progression remains to be fully 
      understood. We performed the large-scale analysis of miRNA expression during PTC 
      progression in BRAFT1799A-transgenic animals (Tg-Braf) and thyroid cancer cell 
      lines and identified the marked downregulation of several miRNAs from the region 
      14q32. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) confirmed the global 
      downregulation of miRNAs from the 14q32 region in human PTC. The regulatory 
      network potentially suppressed by these miRNAs suggests that key cancer-related 
      biological processes such as cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and 
      angiogenesis. Among the downregulated miRNAs, we observed that miR-654-3p levels 
      decrease with long-term PTC progression in Tg-Braf mice and inversely correlate 
      with EMT. The in vitro restoration of miR-654-3p decreased cell proliferation and 
      migration and induced reprogramming of metastasis-related genes, suggesting a 
      tumor suppressor role for this miRNA. In conclusion, we show global 
      downregulation of 14q32-encoded miRNAs in an in vivo model of PTC progression. 
      The potential circuitry in which these miRNAs are involved suggests that these 
      miRNAs could play a key role in the pathophysiology of PTC and therefore be 
      relevant for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Integration of miRNA and gene expression profiles suggest a role for miRNAs in 
      the pathobiological processes of acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin 
      America. Its acute phase is associated with high parasitism, myocarditis and 
      profound myocardial gene expression changes. A chronic phase ensues where 30% 
      develop severe heart lesions. Mouse models of T. cruzi infection have been used 
      to study heart damage in Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to provide an 
      interactome between miRNAs and their targetome in Chagas heart disease by 
      integrating gene and microRNA expression profiling data from hearts of T. cruzi 
      infected mice. Gene expression profiling revealed enrichment in biological 
      processes and pathways associated with immune response and metabolism. Pathways, 
      functional and upstream regulator analysis of the intersections between predicted 
      targets of differentially expressed microRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs 
      revealed enrichment in biological processes and pathways such as IFNγ, TNFα, 
      NF-kB signaling signatures, CTL-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      and Nrf2-modulated antioxidative responses. We also observed enrichment in other 
      key heart disease-related processes like myocarditis, fibrosis, hypertrophy and 
      arrhythmia. Our correlation study suggests that miRNAs may be implicated in the 
      pathophysiological processes taking place the hearts of acutely T. cruzi-infected 
      mice.

AB  - Transcriptome analyses have increased our understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying human diseases. Most approaches aim to identify significant 
      genes by comparing their expression values between healthy subjects and a group 
      of patients with a certain disease. Given that studies normally contain few 
      samples, the heterogeneity among individuals caused by environmental factors or 
      undetected illnesses can impact gene expression analyses. We present a systematic 
      analysis of sample heterogeneity in a variety of gene expression studies relating 
      to inflammatory and infectious diseases and show that novel immunological 
      insights may arise once heterogeneity is addressed. The perturbation score of 
      samples is quantified using nonperturbed subjects (i.e., healthy subjects) as a 
      reference group. Such a score allows us to detect outlying samples and subgroups 
      of diseased patients and even assess the molecular perturbation of single cells 
      infected with viruses. We also show how removal of outlying samples can improve 
      the "signal" of the disease and impact detection of differentially expressed 
      genes. The method is made available via the mdp Bioconductor R package and as a 
      user-friendly webtool, webMDP, available at http://mdp.sysbio.tools.

TI  - ACE2 Expression is Increased in the Lungs of Patients with Comorbidities 
      Associated with Severe COVID-19.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in several thousand deaths worldwide in just a few 
      months. Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had 
      comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung 
      disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial 
      factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study 
      has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. 
      Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with 
      comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly 
      expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding 
      suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of 
      developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be 
      important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses 
      revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes 
      related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, 
      epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by 
      KDM5B. Our systems biology approach offers a possible explanation for increase of 
      COVID-19 severity in patients with certain comorbidities.

TI  - Cross-sectional analysis of students and school workers reveals a high number of 
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections during school reopening in Brazilian cities.

AB  - Brazil experienced one of the most prolonged periods of school closures, and 
      reopening could have exposed students to high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      However, the infection status of students and school workers at the time of the 
      reopening of schools located in Brazilian cities is unknown. Here we evaluated 
      viral carriage by RT-PCR and seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM 
      and IgG) by immunochromatography in 2259 individuals (1139 students and 1120 
      school workers) from 28 schools in 28 Brazilian cities. We collected the samples 
      within 30 days after public schools reopened and before the start of vaccination 
      campaigns. Most students (n = 421) and school workers (n = 446) had active 
      (qRT-PCR + IgM- IgG- or qRT-PCR + IgM + IgG-/+) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regression 
      analysis indicated a strong association between the infection status of students 
      and school workers. Furthermore, while 45% (n = 515) of the students and 37% (n = 
      415) of the school workers were neither antigen nor antibody positive in 
      laboratory tests, 16% of the participants (169 students and 193 school workers) 
      were oligosymptomatic, including those reinfected. These individuals presented 
      mild symptoms such as headache, sore throat, and cough. Notably, most of the 
      individuals were asymptomatic (83.9%). These results indicate that many 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections in Brazilian cities during school reopening were 
      asymptomatic. Thus, our study highlights the need to promote a coordinated public 
      health effort to guarantee a safe educational environment while avoiding 
      exacerbating pre-existent social inequalities in Brazil, reducing social, mental, 
      and economic losses for students, school workers, and their families.

TI  - Co-Exposure of Cardiomyocytes to IFN-γ and TNF-α Induces Mitochondrial 
      Dysfunction and Nitro-Oxidative Stress: Implications for the Pathogenesis of 
      Chronic Chagas Disease Cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 755862

AB  - Infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease cardiomyopathy 
      (CCC) and can lead to arrhythmia, heart failure and death. Chagas disease affects 
      8 million people worldwide, and chronic production of the cytokines IFN-γ and 
      TNF-α by T cells together with mitochondrial dysfunction are important players 
      for the poor prognosis of the disease. Mitochondria occupy 40% of the 
      cardiomyocytes volume and produce 95% of cellular ATP that sustain the life-long 
      cycles of heart contraction. As IFN-γ and TNF-α have been described to affect 
      mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that IFN-γ and TNF-α are involved in the 
      myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction observed in CCC patients. In this study, we 
      quantified markers of mitochondrial dysfunction and nitro-oxidative stress in CCC 
      heart tissue and in IFN-γ/TNF-α-stimulated AC-16 human cardiomyocytes. We found 
      that CCC myocardium displayed increased levels of nitro-oxidative stress and 
      reduced mitochondrial DNA as compared with myocardial tissue from patients with 
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). IFN-γ/TNF-α treatment of AC-16 cardiomyocytes 
      induced increased nitro-oxidative stress and decreased the mitochondrial membrane 
      potential (ΔΨm). We found that the STAT1/NF-κB/NOS2 axis is involved in the 
      IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced decrease of ΔΨm in AC-16 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, 
      treatment with mitochondria-sparing agonists of AMPK, NRF2 and SIRT1 rescues ΔΨm 
      in IFN-γ/TNF-α-stimulated cells. Proteomic and gene expression analyses revealed 
      that IFN-γ/TNF-α-treated cells corroborate mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      transmembrane potential of mitochondria, altered fatty acid metabolism and 
      cardiac necrosis/cell death. Functional assays conducted on Seahorse respirometer 
      showed that cytokine-stimulated cells display decreased glycolytic and 
      mitochondrial ATP production, dependency of fatty acid oxidation as well as 
      increased proton leak and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Together, our 
      results suggest that IFN-γ and TNF-α cause direct damage to cardiomyocytes' 
      mitochondria by promoting oxidative and nitrosative stress and impairing energy 
      production pathways. We hypothesize that treatment with agonists of AMPK, NRF2 
      and SIRT1 might be an approach to ameliorate the progression of Chagas disease 
      cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Systems Biology Analysis of the Radiation-Attenuated Schistosome Vaccine Reveals 
      a Role for Growth Factors in Protection and Hemostasis Inhibition in Parasite 
      Survival.
PG  - 624191
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.624191 [doi]
LID - 624191
AB  - In spite of several decades of research, an effective vaccine against 
      schistosomiasis remains elusive. The radiation-attenuated (RA) cercarial vaccine 
      is still the best model eliciting high protection levels, although the immune 
      mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized. In order to identify genes and 
      pathways underlying protection we investigated patterns of gene expression in 
      PBMC and skin draining Lymph Nodes (LN) from mice using two exposure comparisons: 
      vaccination with 500 attenuated cercariae versus infection with 500 normal 
      cercariae; one versus three doses. Vaccinated mice were challenged with 120 
      normal parasites. Integration of PBMC and LN data from the infected group 
      revealed early up-regulation of pathways associated with Th2 skewing and 
      polarization of IgG antibody profiles. Additionally, hemostasis pathways were 
      downregulated in infected mice, correlating with platelet reduction, potentially 
      a mechanism to assist parasite migration through capillary beds. Conversely, up 
      regulation of such mechanisms after vaccination may explain parasite blockade in 
      the lungs. In contrast, a single exposure to attenuated parasites revealed early 
      establishment of a Th1 bias (signaling of IL-1, IFN-γ; and Leishmania infection). 
      Genes encoding chemokines and their receptors were more prominent in vaccinated 
      mice, indicating an enhanced capacity for inflammation, potentially augmenting 
      the inhibition of intravascular migration. Increasing the vaccinations from one 
      to three did not dramatically elevate protection, but there was a clear shift 
      towards antibody-mediated effectors. However, elements of the Th1 bias were still 
      evident. Notable features after three vaccinations were markers of cytotoxicity 
      (including IL-6 and NK cells) together with growth factors and their receptors 
      (FGFR/VEGF/EGF) and the apoptosis pathway. Indeed, there is evidence for the 
      development of anergy after three vaccinations, borne out by the limited 
      responses detected in samples after challenge. We infer that persistence of a Th1 
      response puts a limit on expression of antibody-mediated mechanisms. This feature 
      may explain the failure of multiple doses to drive protection towards sterile 
      immunity. We suggest that the secretions of lung stage parasites would make a 
      novel cohort of antigens for testing in protection experiments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a temporal and spatial analysis of the 
      2018 measles outbreak in Brazil, particularly in the metropolitan city of Manaus 
      in the Amazon region, and further introduce a new tool for spatial analysis. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the geographical data of the residences of over 7,000 
      individuals with measles in Manaus during 2018 and 2019. Spatial and temporal 
      analyses were conducted to characterize various aspects of the outbreak, 
      including the onset and prevalence of symptoms, demographics, and vaccination 
      status. A visualization tool was also constructed to display the geographical and 
      temporal distribution of the reported measles cases. RESULTS: Approximately 95% 
      of the included participants had not received vaccination within the past decade. 
      Heterogeneity was observed across all facets of the outbreak, including 
      variations in the incubation period and symptom presentation. Age distribution 
      exhibited two peaks, occurring at one year and 18 years of age, and the potential 
      implications of this distribution on predictive analysis were discussed. 
      Additionally, spatial analysis revealed that areas with the highest case 
      densities tended to have the lowest standard of living. CONCLUSION: Understanding 
      the spatial and temporal spread of measles outbreaks provides insights for 
      decision-making regarding measures to mitigate future epidemics.

TI  - Origins of the Xylella fastidiosa prophage-like regions and their impact in 
      genome differentiation.
PG  - e4059
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004059 [doi]
LID - e4059
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram negative plant pathogen causing many economically 
      important diseases, and analyses of completely sequenced X. fastidiosa genome 
      strains allowed the identification of many prophage-like elements and possibly 
      phage remnants, accounting for up to 15% of the genome composition. To better 
      evaluate the recent evolution of the X. fastidiosa chromosome backbone among 
      distinct pathovars, the number and location of prophage-like regions on two 
      finished genomes (9a5c and Temecula1), and in two candidate molecules (Ann1 and 
      Dixon) were assessed. Based on comparative best bidirectional hit analyses, the 
      majority (51%) of the predicted genes in the X. fastidiosa prophage-like regions 
      are related to structural phage genes belonging to the Siphoviridae family. 
      Electron micrograph reveals the existence of putative viral particles with 
      similar morphology to lambda phages in the bacterial cell in planta. Moreover, 
      analysis of microarray data indicates that 9a5c strain cultivated under stress 
      conditions presents enhanced expression of phage anti-repressor genes, suggesting 
      switches from lysogenic to lytic cycle of phages under stress-induced situations. 
      Furthermore, virulence-associated proteins and toxins are found within these 
      prophage-like elements, thus suggesting an important role in host adaptation. 
      Finally, clustering analyses of phage integrase genes based on multiple alignment 
      patterns reveal they group in five lineages, all possessing a tyrosine 
      recombinase catalytic domain, and phylogenetically close to other integrases 
      found in phages that are genetic mosaics and able to perform generalized and 
      specialized transduction. Integration sites and tRNA association is also 
      evidenced. In summary, we present comparative and experimental evidence 
      supporting the association and contribution of phage activity on the 
      differentiation of Xylella genomes.

      Plasmodium vivax Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (PvRON2).
PG  - 401

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of malaria antigens often results in allele 
      variant-specific immunity, imposing a great challenge to vaccine development. 
      Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (PvRON2) is a blood-stage antigen that plays a key role 
      during the erythrocyte invasion of Plasmodium vivax. This study investigates the 
      genetic diversity of PvRON2 and the naturally acquired immune response to P. 
      vivax isolates. RESULTS: Here, the genetic diversity of PvRON2(1828-2080) and the 
      naturally acquired humoral immune response against PvRON2(1828-2080) in infected 
      and non-infected individuals from a vivax malaria endemic area in Brazil was 
      reported. The diversity analysis of PvRON2(1828-2080) revealed that the protein 
      is conserved in isolates in Brazil and worldwide. A total of 18 (19%) patients 
      had IgG antibodies to PvRON2(1828-2080). Additionally, the analysis of the 
      antibody response in individuals who were not acutely infected with malaria, but 
      had been infected with malaria in the past indicated that 32 patients (33%) 
      exhibited an IgG immune response against PvRON2. CONCLUSIONS: PvRON2 was 
      conserved among the studied isolates. The presence of naturally acquired 
      antibodies to this protein in the absence of the disease suggests that PvRON2 
      induces a long-term antibody response. These results indicate that PvRON2 is a 
      potential malaria vaccine candidate.

AB  - Patients infected with the Dengue virus (DENV) often present with a massive 
      generation of DENV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the blood. In some 
      cases, these ASCs represent more than 50% of the circulating B cells, a higher 
      magnitude than those induced by other infections, vaccinations, and plasma cell 
      lymphomas. However, it remains unclear how the DENV infection elicits this 
      colossal response. To address this issue, we utilised an in vitro strategy to 
      induce human PBMCs of healthy individuals incubated with DENV particles (DENV4 
      TVP/360) to differentiate into ASCs. As controls, PBMCs were incubated with a 
      mitogen cocktail or supernatants of uninfected C6/36 cells (mock). The ASC 
      phenotype and function were increasingly detected in the DENV and 
      mitogen-cultured PBMCs as compared to mock-treated cells. In contrast to the in 
      vivo condition, secreted IgG derived from the PBMC-DENV culture was not 
      DENV-specific. Lower ASC numbers were observed when inactivated viral particles 
      or purified B cells were added to the cultures. The physical contact was 
      essential between B cells and the remaining PBMCs for the DENV-mediated ASC 
      response. Considering the evidence for the activation of the tryptophan 
      metabolism detected in the serum of Dengue patients, we assessed its relevance in 
      the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation. For this, tryptophan and its respective 
      metabolites were quantified in the supernatants of cell cultures through mass 
      spectrophotometry. Tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation were found in 
      the supernatants of PBMC-DENV cultures, which presented enhanced detection of 
      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 transcripts as compared to controls. In 
      PBMC-DENV cultures, tryptophan and kynurenine levels strongly correlated to the 
      respective ASC numbers, while the kynurenine levels were directly proportional to 
      the secreted IgG titers. Contrastingly, PBMCs incubated with Zika or attenuated 
      Yellow Fever viruses showed no correlation between their kynurenine 
      concentrations and ASC numbers. Therefore, our data revealed the existence of 
      distinct pathways for the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation and suggest the 
      involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in this cellular process triggered by 
      flavivirus infections.

TI  - Specific inhibition of NLRP3 in chikungunya disease reveals a role for 
      inflammasomes in alphavirus-induced inflammation.
PG  - 1435-1445
LID - 10.1038/s41564-017-0015-4 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne viruses can cause severe inflammatory diseases and there are 
      limited therapeutic solutions targeted specifically at virus-induced 
      inflammation. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging alphavirus responsible for 
      several outbreaks worldwide in the past decade, causes debilitating joint 
      inflammation and severe pain. Here, we show that CHIKV infection activates the 
      NLRP3 inflammasome in humans and mice. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      isolated from CHIKV-infected patients showed elevated NLRP3, caspase-1 and 
      interleukin-18 messenger RNA expression and, using a mouse model of CHIKV 
      infection, we found that high NLRP3 expression was associated with peak 
      inflammatory symptoms. Inhibition of NLRP3 activation using the small-molecule 
      inhibitor MCC950 resulted in reduced CHIKV-induced inflammation and abrogated 
      osteoclastogenic bone loss and myositis, but did not affect in vivo viral 
      replication. Mice treated with MCC950 displayed lower expression levels of the 
      cytokines interleukin-6, chemokine ligand 2 and tumour necrosis factor in joint 
      tissue. Interestingly, MCC950 treatment abrogated disease signs in mice infected 
      with a related arthritogenic alphavirus, Ross River virus, but not in mice 
      infected with West Nile virus-a flavivirus. Here, using mouse models of 
      alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease, we demonstrate that NLRP3 inhibition 
      in vivo can reduce inflammatory pathology and that further development of 
      therapeutic solutions targeting inflammasome function could help treat arboviral 
      diseases.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health challenge, with the current BCG 
      vaccine providing limited efficacy in adults, and available treatments being 
      lengthy and debilitating. To overcome these challenges, we have previously 
      developed a recombinant BCG strain expressing the detoxified E. coli Heat-Labile 
      Toxin (LTAK63), providing increased protection in mouse models and reduced lung 
      pathology. Here, using systems biology and RNA sequencing of lung tissues in a 
      murine model, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying rBCG-LTAK63's 
      increased protection. Immunization triggered early activation of cAMP-related 
      pathways, leading to hypoxia, autophagy, and circadian rhythm gene regulation. 
      These processes were associated with an enhanced innate immunity and promoted 
      long-lasting Th1/Th17 adaptive responses. Upon challenge, mice immunized with 
      rBCG-LTAK63 exhibited an earlier onset of interferon-gamma response, reduced 
      bacterial burden, and improved lung histopathology. Notably, circadian rhythm 
      regulation was directly linked to a controlled inflammatory response and reduced 
      migration of infection-susceptible cells, resulting in decreased immunopathology. 
      Our findings demonstrate that rBCG-LTAK63 orchestrates protection through the 
      integration of metabolic and temporal immune pathways. This work provides 
      mechanistic insights into how rational vaccine design can reprogram host immunity 
      to enhance protection and reduce pathology, supporting rBCG-LTAK63 as a promising 
      next-generation TB vaccine candidate.

AB  - CD8 T cells are a potent tool for eliminating intracellular pathogens and tumor 
      cells. Thus, eliciting robust CD8 T-cell immunity is the basis for many vaccines 
      under development. However, the relationship between antigen load and the 
      magnitude of the CD8 T-cell response is not well-described in a human immune 
      response. Here we address this issue by quantifying viral load and the CD8 T-cell 
      response in a cohort of 80 individuals immunized with the live attenuated yellow 
      fever vaccine (YFV-17D) by sampling peripheral blood at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 
      11, 14, 30, and 90. When the virus load was below a threshold (peak virus load < 
      225 genomes per mL, or integrated virus load < 400 genome days per mL), the 
      magnitude of the CD8 T-cell response correlated strongly with the virus load 
      (R(2) ∼ 0.63). As the virus load increased above this threshold, the magnitude of 
      the CD8 T-cell responses saturated. Recent advances in CD8 T-cell-based vaccines 
      have focused on replication-incompetent or single-cycle vectors. However, these 
      approaches deliver relatively limited amounts of antigen after immunization. Our 
      results highlight the requirement that T-cell-based vaccines should deliver 
      sufficient antigen during the initial period of the immune response to elicit a 
      large number of CD8 T cells that may be needed for protection.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune arthropathy characterized by chronic 
      articular inflammation. Methotrexate (MTX) remains the first-line therapy for RA 
      and its anti-inflammatory effect is associated with the maintenance of high 
      levels of extracellular adenosine (ADO). Nonetheless, up to 40% of RA patients 
      are resistant to MTX treatment and this is linked to a reduction of CD39 
      expression, an ectoenzyme involved in the generation of extracellular ADO by ATP 
      metabolism, on circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the mechanism 
      mediating the reduction of CD39 expression on Tregs is unknown. Here we 
      demonstrated that the impairment in TGF-β signalling lead to the reduction of 
      CD39 expression on Tregs that accounts for MTX resistance. TGF-β increases CD39 
      expression on Tregs via the activation of TGFBRII/TGFBRI, SMAD2 and the 
      transcription factor CREB, which is activated in a p38-dependent manner and 
      induces CD39 expression by promoting ENTPD1 gene transcription. Importantly, 
      unresponsive patients to MTX (UR-MTX) show reduced expression of TGFBR2 and CREB1 
      and decreased levels of p-SMAD2 and p-CREB in Tregs compared to MTX-responsive 
      patients (R-MTX). Furthermore, RA patients carrying at least one mutant allele 
      for rs1431131 (AT or AA) of the TGFBR2 gene are significantly (p = 0.0006) 
      associated with UR-MTX. Therefore, we have uncovered a molecular mechanism for 
      the reduced CD39 expression on Tregs, and revealed potential targets for 
      therapeutic intervention for MTX resistance.

TI  - Genomic analyses reveal broad impact of miR-137 on genes associated with 
      malignant transformation and neuronal differentiation in glioblastoma cells.
PG  - e85591

AB  - miR-137 plays critical roles in the nervous system and tumor development; an 
      increase in its expression is required for neuronal differentiation while its 
      reduction is implicated in gliomagenesis. To evaluate the potential of miR-137 in 
      glioblastoma therapy, we conducted genome-wide target mapping in glioblastoma 
      cells by measuring the level of association between PABP and mRNAs in cells 
      transfected with miR-137 mimics vs. controls via RIPSeq. Impact on mRNA levels 
      was also measured by RNASeq. By combining the results of both experimental 
      approaches, 1468 genes were found to be negatively impacted by miR-137--among 
      them, 595 (40%) contain miR-137 predicted sites. The most relevant targets 
      include oncogenic proteins and key players in neurogenesis like c-KIT, YBX1, 
      AKT2, CDC42, CDK6 and TGFβ2. Interestingly, we observed that several identified 
      miR-137 targets are also predicted to be regulated by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-7, 
      which are equally implicated in neuronal differentiation and gliomagenesis. We 
      suggest that the concomitant increase of these four miRNAs in neuronal stem cells 
      or their repression in tumor cells could produce a robust regulatory effect with 
      major consequences to neuronal differentiation and tumorigenesis.

AB  - Resolution of acute and chronic viral infections requires activation of innate 
      cells to initiate and maintain adaptive immune responses. Here we report that 
      infection with acute Armstrong (ARM) or chronic Clone 13 (C13) strains of 
      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) led to two distinct phases of innate 
      immune response. During the first 72 hr of infection, dendritic cells upregulated 
      activation markers and stimulated antiviral CD8(+) T cells, independent of viral 
      strain. Seven days after infection, there was an increase in Ly6C(hi) monocytic 
      and Gr-1(hi) neutrophilic cells in lymphoid organs and blood. This expansion in 
      cell numbers was enhanced and sustained in C13 infection, whereas it occurred 
      only transiently with ARM infection. These cells resembled myeloid-derived 
      suppressor cells and potently suppressed T cell proliferation. The reduction of 
      monocytic cells in Ccr2(-/-) mice or after Gr-1 antibody depletion enhanced 
      antiviral T cell function. Thus, innate cells have an important immunomodulatory 
      role throughout chronic infection.

AB  - Melanoma is a highly invasive and metastatic cancer with high mortality rates and 
      chemoresistance. Around 50% of melanomas are driven by activating mutations in 
      BRAF that has led to the development of potent anti-BRAF inhibitors. However 
      resistance to anti-BRAF therapy usually develops within a few months and 
      consequently there is a need to identify alternative therapies that will bypass 
      BRAF inhibitor resistance. The curcumin analogue DM-1 (sodium 
      4-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-3-oxo-penta-1,4-dienyl]-2-methoxy-phenolate) 
      has substantial anti-tumor activity in melanoma, but its mechanism of action 
      remains unclear. Here we use a synthetic lethal genetic screen in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae to identify 211 genes implicated in sensitivity to DM-1 toxicity. From 
      these 211 genes, 74 had close human orthologues implicated in oxidative 
      phosphorylation, insulin signaling and iron and RNA metabolism. Further analysis 
      identified 7 target genes (ADK, ATP6V0B, PEMT, TOP1, ZFP36, ZFP36L1, ZFP36L2) 
      with differential expression during melanoma progression implicated in regulation 
      of tumor progression, cell differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition. Of these TOP1 and ADK were regulated by DM-1 in treatment-naïve and 
      vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells respectively. These data reveal that the 
      anticancer effect of curcumin analogues is likely to be mediated via multiple 
      targets and identify several genes that represent candidates for combinatorial 
      targeting in melanoma.

TI  - miRNAs may play a major role in the control of gene expression in key 
      pathobiological processes in Chagas disease cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC), an especially aggressive 
      inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy caused by lifelong infection with the 
      protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. 
      Although chronic myocarditis may play a major pathogenetic role, little is known 
      about the molecular mechanisms responsible for its severity. The aim of this 
      study is to study the genes and microRNAs expression in tissues and their 
      connections in regards to the pathobiological processes. To do so, we integrated 
      for the first time global microRNA and mRNA expression profiling from myocardial 
      tissue of CCC patients employing pathways and network analyses. We observed an 
      enrichment in biological processes and pathways associated with the immune 
      response and metabolism. IFNγ, TNF and NFkB were the top upstream regulators. The 
      intersections between differentially expressed microRNAs and differentially 
      expressed target mRNAs showed an enrichment in biological processes such as 
      Inflammation, inflammation, Th1/IFN-γ-inducible genes, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and 
      mitochondrial/oxidative stress/antioxidant response. MicroRNAs also played a role 
      in the regulation of gene expression involved in the key cardiomyopathy-related 
      processes fibrosis, hypertrophy, myocarditis and arrhythmia. Significantly, a 
      discrete number of differentially expressed microRNAs targeted a high number of 
      differentially expressed mRNAs (>20) in multiple processes. Our results suggest 
      that miRNAs orchestrate expression of multiple genes in the major 
      pathophysiological processes in CCC heart tissue. This may have a bearing on 
      pathogenesis, biomarkers and therapy.

AB  - T cell dysfunction is an important feature of many chronic viral infections. In 
      particular, it was shown that programmed death-1 (PD-1) regulates T cell 
      dysfunction during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice, 
      and PD-1(hi) cells exhibit an intense exhausted gene signature. These findings 
      were extended to human chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and 
      hepatitis B virus. However, it is not known if PD-1(hi) cells of healthy humans 
      have the traits of exhausted cells. In this study, we provide a comprehensive 
      description of phenotype, function, and gene expression profiles of PD-1(hi) 
      versus PD-1(lo) CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy human adults as 
      follows: 1) the percentage of naive and memory CD8 T cells varied widely in the 
      peripheral blood cells of healthy humans, and PD-1 was expressed by the memory 
      CD8 T cells; 2) PD-1(hi) CD8 T cells in healthy humans did not significantly 
      correlate with the PD-1(hi) exhausted gene signature of HIV-specific human CD8 T 
      cells or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8 T cells from 
      mice; 3) PD-1 expression did not directly affect the ability of CD8 T cells to 
      secrete cytokines in healthy adults; 4) PD-1 was expressed by the effector memory 
      compared with terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells; and 5) finally, an 
      interesting inverse relationship between CD45RA and PD-1 expression was observed. 
      In conclusion, our study shows that most PD-1(hi) CD8 T cells in healthy adult 
      humans are effector memory cells rather than exhausted cells.

TI  - Molecular degree of perturbation of plasma inflammatory markers associated with 
      tuberculosis reveals distinct disease profiles between Indian and Chinese 
      populations.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection which causes tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
      Clinical presentation of TB patients is very diverse and disease heterogeneity is 
      associated with changes in biomarker signatures. Here, we compared at the 
      molecular level the extent of individual inflammatory perturbation of plasma 
      protein and lipid mediators associated with TB in patients in China versus India. 
      We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing the overall degree of inflammatory 
      perturbation in treatment-naïve pulmonary TB patients and uninfected individuals 
      from India (TB: n = 97, healthy: n = 20) and China (TB: n = 100, healthy: 
      n = 11). We employed the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) adapted to plasma 
      biomarkers to examine the overall changes in inflammation between these 
      countries. M. tuberculosis infection caused a significant degree of molecular 
      perturbation in patients from both countries, with higher perturbation detected 
      in India. Interestingly, there were differences in biomarker perturbation 
      patterns and the overall degree of inflammation. Patients with severe TB 
      exhibited increased MDP values and Indian patients with this condition exhibited 
      even higher degree of perturbation compared to Chinese patients. Network analyses 
      identified IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1RI and TNF-α as combined biomarkers that account for 
      the overall molecular perturbation in the entire study population. Our results 
      delineate the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory perturbation in pulmonary TB 
      and reveal qualitative changes in inflammatory profiles between two countries 
      with high disease prevalence.

TI  - Transcriptomic and Immunopathological Profiles of Inflammasomes in Different 
      Clinical Forms of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13050980 [doi]
LID - 980
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) 
      amazonensis and L. (Viannia) braziliensis, presents a wide spectrum of clinical 
      and immunopathological manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (LCL) to severe forms like anergic diffuse cutaneous (ADCL) and 
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Despite evidence of the immune response's 
      complexity, the role of inflammasomes in disease severity and parasite 
      persistence remains unclear. We investigated the transcriptomic and 
      immunopathological profiles of inflammasome components in patient lesions across 
      the clinical spectrum. Genes such as NLRP3, AIM2, NLRP12, NLRC4, CASP1, CASP5, 
      GSDMD, and IL1B and all evaluated proteins, showed higher expression in ACL 
      compared to healthy controls. Distinct inflammasome activation patterns were 
      observed: MCL, the hyperreactive form, showed elevated NLRP3, AIM2, and IL-1β, 
      indicating an intensified inflammatory environment. ADCL, the hyporeactive form, 
      displayed increased NLRP12 and NLRC4 expression with reduced GSDMD. Localized 
      forms showed transitional profiles, highlighting ACL's multifactorial 
      pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms 
      in ACL, identifying potential therapeutic targets to modulate inflammation and 
      improve management.

AB  - We report the results of the world's first trial of a vaccine against elephant 
      endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) in elephants. EEHV-induced haemorrhagic 
      disease is a major threat to juvenile Asian elephants. A vaccine preventing 
      severe disease and death would support conservation efforts for this endangered 
      species. We developed a heterologous, recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara 
      prime and adjuvanted protein boost vaccine, containing regulatory protein EE2 and 
      major capsid protein. Vaccine design targeted Th1 and cytotoxic T cell responses, 
      crucial for herpesvirus immunity. In a proof-of-concept trial, safety and 
      immunogenicity were tested in adult elephants. A modified interferon-γ release 
      (IFNG) point-of-care vaccine-specific whole blood assay was established to avoid 
      sample transport-related loss of immune readouts and determine T cell responses 
      by RT-qPCR first. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was utilised to investigate 
      transcriptomic changes post-vaccination. No adverse reactions were observed 
      following heterologous vaccination. IFNG responses to candidate antigens were 
      detected against the pre-existing latent immunity in adult elephants. 
      Over-representation analysis revealed induction of T cell-associated pathways. 
      Thus, we show that the vaccine has a favourable safety profile and stimulates 
      EEHV-specific T cell-biased immune responses, warranting further evaluation.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Selectively Induces the Expression of Unproductive Splicing Isoforms 
      of Interferon, Class I MHC, and Splicing Machinery Genes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25115671 [doi]
LID - 5671
AB  - RNA processing is a highly conserved mechanism that serves as a pivotal regulator 
      of gene expression. Alternative processing generates transcripts that can still 
      be translated but lead to potentially nonfunctional proteins. A plethora of 
      respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), strategically manipulate the host's RNA processing machinery to 
      circumvent antiviral responses. We integrated publicly available omics datasets 
      to systematically analyze isoform-level expression and delineate the nascent 
      peptide landscape of SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells. Our findings explore a 
      suggested but uncharacterized mechanism, whereby SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the 
      predominant expression of unproductive splicing isoforms in key IFN signaling, 
      interferon-stimulated (ISGs), class I MHC, and splicing machinery genes, 
      including IRF7, HLA-B, and HNRNPH1. In stark contrast, cytokine and chemokine 
      genes, such as IL6 and TNF, predominantly express productive (protein-coding) 
      splicing isoforms in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We postulate that 
      SARS-CoV-2 employs an unreported tactic of exploiting the host splicing machinery 
      to bolster viral replication and subvert the immune response by selectively 
      upregulating unproductive splicing isoforms from antigen presentation and 
      antiviral response genes. Our study sheds new light on the molecular interplay 
      between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system, offering a foundation for the 
      development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The progression and severity of COVID-19 vary significantly in the 
      population. While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine 
      laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles 
      is still unknown. METHODS: A multidimensional analysis was performed involving 
      millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178 887 
      individuals from Brazil, of whom 33 266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analyzed 
      data included those relating to complete blood cell count, electrolytes, 
      metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and 
      others. FINDINGS: COVID-19 induced similar alterations in laboratory parameters 
      in males and females. CRP and ferritin were increased, especially in older men 
      with COVID-19, whereas abnormal liver function tests were common across several 
      age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and 
      eosinophils were more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female 
      COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units displayed alterations in the 
      coagulation system, and higher values for neutrophils, CRP, and lactate 
      dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the laboratory profiles of a 
      large cohort of COVID-19 patients, which formed the basis of discrepancies 
      influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly linked COVID-19 
      disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age, and immune 
      activation.

TI  - The iron stimulon of Xylella fastidiosa includes genes for type IV pilus and 
      colicin V-like bacteriocins.

AB  - Xylella fastidiosa is the etiologic agent of a wide range of plant diseases, 
      including citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), a major threat to citrus industry. 
      The genomes of several strains of this phytopathogen were completely sequenced, 
      enabling large-scale functional studies. DNA microarrays representing 2,608 
      (91.6%) coding sequences (CDS) of X. fastidiosa CVC strain 9a5c were used to 
      investigate transcript levels during growth with different iron availabilities. 
      When treated with the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, 193 CDS were considered 
      up-regulated and 216 were considered down-regulated. Upon incubation with 100 
      microM ferric pyrophosphate, 218 and 256 CDS were considered up- and 
      down-regulated, respectively. Differential expression for a subset of 44 CDS was 
      further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Several CDS involved 
      with regulatory functions, pathogenicity, and cell structure were modulated under 
      both conditions assayed, suggesting that major changes in cell architecture and 
      metabolism occur when X. fastidiosa cells are exposed to extreme variations in 
      iron concentration. Interestingly, the modulated CDS include those related to 
      colicin V-like bacteriocin synthesis and secretion and to functions of 
      pili/fimbriae. We also investigated the contribution of the ferric uptake 
      regulator Fur to the iron stimulon of X. fastidiosa. The promoter regions of the 
      strain 9a5c genome were screened for putative Fur boxes, and candidates were 
      analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, our data 
      support the hypothesis that Fur is not solely responsible for the modulation of 
      the iron stimulon of X. fastidiosa, and they present novel evidence for iron 
      regulation of pathogenicity determinants.

TI  - In situ Immune Signatures and Microbial Load at the Nasopharyngeal Interface in 
      Children With Acute Respiratory Infection.
PG  - 2475
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02475 [doi]
LID - 2475
AB  - Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the most frequent cause for hospitalization 
      in infants and young children. Using multiplexed nCounter technology to digitally 
      quantify 600 human mRNAs in parallel with 14 virus- and 5 bacterium-specific 
      RNAs, we characterized viral and bacterial presence in nasopharyngeal aspirates 
      (NPA) of 58 children with ARI and determined the corresponding in situ immune 
      profiles. NPA contained different groups of organisms and these were classified 
      into bacterial (n = 27), viral (n = 5), codetection [containing both viral and 
      bacterial transcripts (n = 21), or indeterminate intermediate where microbial 
      load is below threshold (n = 5)]. We then identified differentially expressed 
      immune transcripts (DEITs) comparing NPAs from symptomatic children vs. healthy 
      controls, and comparing children presenting NPAs with detectable microbial load 
      vs. indeterminate. We observed a strong innate immune response in NPAs, due to 
      the presence of evolutionarily conserved type I Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes 
      (ISG), which was correlated with total bacterial and/or viral load. In comparison 
      with indeterminate NPAs, adaptive immunity transcripts discriminated among viral, 
      bacterial, and codetected microbial profiles. In viral NPAs, B cell transcripts 
      were significantly enriched among DEITs, while only type III IFN was correlated 
      with viral load. In bacterial NPAs, myeloid cells and coinhibitory transcripts 
      were enriched and significantly correlated with bacterial load. In conclusion, 
      digital nCounter transcriptomics provide a microbial and immunological in situ 
      "snapshot" of the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ARI. This enabled 
      discrimination among viral, bacterial, codetection, and indeterminate transcripts 
      in the samples using non-invasive sampling.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a need for mucosal vaccines that can fight pathogens at 
      the site of infection. At present, there are no approved adjuvants for mucosal 
      vaccines. Among different immunization routes, oral delivery is the natural 
      choice because of its ease of administration. However, oral administration has 
      two main drawbacks: proteolytic digestion and immune tolerance. METHODS: In this 
      study, a systematic in silico screening of putative protease inhibitors (PIs) 
      from bacteria to identify novel oral vaccine adjuvants was conducted. Selected 
      candidates were then evaluated for their ability to inhibit gastrointestinal 
      proteases and to stimulate murine dendritic cells. Finally, promising candidates 
      were incorporated as adjuvants into oral vaccine formulations containing model 
      (OVA) or real antigens, such as the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and tetanus 
      toxoid and tested in in vivo experiments. In addition, a proteomic analysis to 
      assess their effects on dendritic cells was performed. RESULTS: This approach led 
      to the selection of 11 PIs from human pathogenic bacteria, representing diverse 
      families of PIs. These proteins were then expressed in E. coli; five of them 
      demonstrated soluble expression and efficient purification. Three candidates 
      -Ecotin from Salmonella, APRin from Pseudomonas, and STA (staphostatin A) from 
      Staphylococcus aureus- exhibited both protease inhibition and TLR4-independent 
      dendritic-cell activation. In vivo studies demonstrated that Ecotin, APRin, and 
      STA enhanced immune responses when orally co-administered with OVA, promoting 
      T-cell proliferation and antibody production. Further evaluation with real 
      antigens, confirmed their adjuvant effect by inducing mucosal and systemic 
      immunity. Proteomic analysis of dendritic cells treated with these proteins 
      revealed significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, including interferon 
      and TNF-signaling, as well as metabolic pathways linked to immune activation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that three protease inhibitors from 
      bacteria: Ecotin, APRin, and STA function as novel oral mucosal adjuvants capable 
      of modulating immune responses and enhancing antigen immunogenicity.

TI  - Integrative neuroimmunology reveals leukocyte-expressing PAX6 as a critical 
      predictor of major depressive disorder.
LID - 10.1038/s41398-025-03776-8 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifaceted psychiatric illness with 
      profound global consequences. To illuminate its molecular underpinnings, we 
      employed a genome-driven integrative systems neuroimmunology approach to analyze 
      transcriptomic profiles from 3114 individuals (1877 MDD patients and 1237 
      controls). This analysis uncovered coordinated neuroimmune transcriptomic shifts, 
      marked by altered expression of genes involved in innate immune regulation, 
      suppression of inflammatory responses, and pathways related to sensory 
      perception, visual system development, and synaptic signaling. These alterations 
      were consistently observed in both peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and brain 
      regions implicated in MDD. Among 31 genes jointly dysregulated in blood and 
      brain, four stood out as robust predictors of MDD in PBLs: NEGR1, PPP6C, SORCS3, 
      and PAX6. Of these, PAX6, a gene previously linked to MDD by GWAS, also exhibited 
      differential expression in the amygdala and was functionally enriched in pathways 
      governing immune modulation, vesicle trafficking, and neurodevelopmental 
      processes, such as neuronal fate determination. In contrast, NEGR1, PPP6C, and 
      SORCS3 showed no significant changes in brain expression, suggesting a 
      predominantly peripheral role. Importantly, these transcriptomic insights were 
      reinforced in a murine model of chronic stress, where immunophenotyping revealed 
      elevated PAX6 expression in peripheral myeloid cells. Together, these findings 
      reveal a shared neuroimmune signature across the brain and immune system in MDD, 
      highlighting PAX6 as a promising mechanistic link and potential biomarker for 
      this disorder.

TI  - Adjuvanting a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Vaccine with Toll-Like Receptor 
      Ligands Encapsulated in Nanoparticles Induces Persistent Antibody Responses and 
      Enhanced Protection in TRIM5α Restrictive Macaques.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01844-16 [doi]
LID - e01844-16
AB  - Our previous work has shown that antigens adjuvanted with ligands specific for 
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR7/8 encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic) 
      acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) induce robust and durable immune responses 
      in mice and macaques. We investigated the efficacy of these NP adjuvants in 
      inducing protective immunity against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Rhesus 
      macaques (RMs) were immunized with NPs containing TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists mixed 
      with soluble recombinant SIVmac239-derived envelope (Env) gp140 and Gag p55 
      (protein) or with virus-like particles (VLPs) containing SIVmac239 Env and Gag. 
      NP-adjuvanted vaccines induced robust innate responses, antigen-specific antibody 
      responses of a greater magnitude and persistence, and enhanced plasmablast 
      responses compared to those achieved with alum-adjuvanted vaccines. NP-adjuvanted 
      vaccines induced antigen-specific, long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which 
      persisted in the bone marrow for several months after vaccination. NP-adjuvanted 
      vaccines induced immune responses that were associated with enhanced protection 
      against repeated low-dose, intravaginal challenges with heterologous SIVsmE660 in 
      animals that carried TRIM5α restrictive alleles. The protection induced by 
      immunization with protein-NP correlated with the prechallenge titers of 
      Env-specific IgG antibodies in serum and vaginal secretions. However, no such 
      correlate was apparent for immunization with VLP-NP or alum as the adjuvant. 
      Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated within 
      the first few hours to days after primary vaccination revealed that NP-adjuvanted 
      vaccines induced a molecular signature similar to that induced by the live 
      attenuated yellow fever viral vaccine. This systems approach identified early 
      blood transcriptional signatures that correlate with Env-specific antibody 
      responses in vaginal secretions and protection against infection. These results 
      demonstrate the adjuvanticity of the NP adjuvant in inducing persistent and 
      protective antibody responses against SIV in RMs with implications for the design 
      of vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). IMPORTANCE: The results 
      of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial, which demonstrated a rapid waning of protective 
      immunity with time, have underscored the need to develop strategies to enhance 
      the durability of protective immune responses. Our recent work in mice has 
      highlighted the capacity of nanoparticle-encapsulated TLR ligands (NP) to induce 
      potent and durable antibody responses that last a lifetime in mice. In the 
      present study, we evaluated the ability of these NP adjuvants to promote robust 
      and durable protective immune responses against SIV in nonhuman primates. Our 
      results demonstrate that immunization of rhesus macaques with NP adjuvants mixed 
      with soluble SIV Env or a virus-like particle form of Env (VLP) induces potent 
      and durable Env-specific antibody responses in the serum and in vaginal 
      secretions. These responses were superior to those induced by alum adjuvant, and 
      they resulted in enhanced protection against a low-dose intravaginal challenge 
      with a heterologous strain of SIV in animals with TRIM5a restrictive alleles. 
      These results highlight the potential for such NP TLR L adjuvants in promoting 
      robust and durable antibody responses against HIV in the next generation of HIV 
      immunogens currently being developed.

TI  - The intronic long noncoding RNA ANRASSF1 recruits PRC2 to the RASSF1A promoter, 
      reducing the expression of RASSF1A and increasing cell proliferation.
PG  - e1003705
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003705 [doi]
LID - e1003705
AB  - The down-regulation of the tumor-suppressor gene RASSF1A has been shown to 
      increase cell proliferation in several tumors. RASSF1A expression is regulated 
      through epigenetic events involving the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2); 
      however, the molecular mechanisms modulating the recruitment of this epigenetic 
      modifier to the RASSF1 locus remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and 
      characterize ANRASSF1, an endogenous unspliced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that 
      is transcribed from the opposite strand on the RASSF1 gene locus in several cell 
      lines and tissues and binds PRC2. ANRASSF1 is transcribed through RNA polymerase 
      II and is 5'-capped and polyadenylated; it exhibits nuclear localization and has 
      a shorter half-life compared with other lncRNAs that bind PRC2. ANRASSF1 
      endogenous expression is higher in breast and prostate tumor cell lines compared 
      with non-tumor, and an opposite pattern is observed for RASSF1A. ANRASSF1 ectopic 
      overexpression reduces RASSF1A abundance and increases the proliferation of HeLa 
      cells, whereas ANRASSF1 silencing causes the opposite effects. These changes in 
      ANRASSF1 levels do not affect the RASSF1C isoform abundance. ANRASSF1 
      overexpression causes a marked increase in both PRC2 occupancy and histone 
      H3K27me3 repressive marks, specifically at the RASSF1A promoter region. No effect 
      of ANRASSF1 overexpression was detected on PRC2 occupancy and histone H3K27me3 at 
      the promoter regions of RASSF1C and the four other neighboring genes, including 
      two well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, we demonstrated that 
      ANRASSF1 forms an RNA/DNA hybrid and recruits PRC2 to the RASSF1A promoter. 
      Together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism of epigenetic repression of 
      the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene involving antisense unspliced lncRNA, in which 
      ANRASSF1 selectively represses the expression of the RASSF1 isoform overlapping 
      the antisense transcript in a location-specific manner. In a broader perspective, 
      our findings suggest that other non-characterized unspliced intronic lncRNAs 
      transcribed in the human genome might contribute to a location-specific 
      epigenetic modulation of genes.

TI  - Genome mapping and expression analyses of human intronic noncoding RNAs reveal 
      tissue-specific patterns and enrichment in genes related to regulation of 
      transcription.
PG  - R43
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNAs transcribed from intronic regions of genes are involved in a 
      number of processes related to post-transcriptional control of gene expression. 
      However, the complement of human genes in which introns are transcribed, and the 
      number of intronic transcriptional units and their tissue expression patterns are 
      not known. RESULTS: A survey of mRNA and EST public databases revealed more than 
      55,000 totally intronic noncoding (TIN) RNAs transcribed from the introns of 74% 
      of all unique RefSeq genes. Guided by this information, we designed an oligoarray 
      platform containing sense and antisense probes for each of 7,135 randomly 
      selected TIN transcripts plus the corresponding protein-coding genes. We 
      identified exonic and intronic tissue-specific expression signatures for human 
      liver, prostate and kidney. The most highly expressed antisense TIN RNAs were 
      transcribed from introns of protein-coding genes significantly enriched (p = 
      0.002 to 0.022) in the 'Regulation of transcription' Gene Ontology category. RNA 
      polymerase II inhibition resulted in increased expression of a fraction of 
      intronic RNAs in cell cultures, suggesting that other RNA polymerases may be 
      involved in their biosynthesis. Members of a subset of intronic and 
      protein-coding signatures transcribed from the same genomic loci have correlated 
      expression patterns, suggesting that intronic RNAs regulate the abundance or the 
      pattern of exon usage in protein-coding messages. CONCLUSION: We have identified 
      diverse intronic RNA expression patterns, pointing to distinct regulatory roles. 
      This gene-oriented approach, using a combined intron-exon oligoarray, should 
      permit further comparative analysis of intronic transcription under various 
      physiological and pathological conditions, thus advancing current knowledge about 
      the biological functions of these noncoding RNAs.

TI  - Gene profiling of Chikungunya virus arthritis in a mouse model reveals 
      significant overlap with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 3553-63
LID - 10.1002/art.34631 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes a 
      chronic debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, for which current treatments 
      are often inadequate. To assess whether new drugs being developed for rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) might find utility in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides, we 
      sought to determine whether the inflammatory gene expression signature of CHIKV 
      arthritis shows any similarities with RA or collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a 
      mouse model of RA. METHODS: Using a recently developed animal model of CHIKV 
      arthritis in adult wild-type mice, we generated a consensus CHIKV arthritis gene 
      expression signature, which was used to interrogate publicly available microarray 
      studies of RA and CIA. Pathway analyses were then performed using the overlapping 
      gene signatures. RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis showed that there was a 
      highly significant overlap in the differentially expressed genes in the CHIKV 
      arthritis model and in RA. This concordance also increased with the severity of 
      RA, as measured by the inflammation score. A highly significant overlap was also 
      seen between CHIKV arthritis and CIA. Pathway analysis revealed that the overlap 
      between these arthritides was spread over a range of different inflammatory 
      processes. Involvement of T cells and interferon-γ (IFNγ) in CHIKV arthritis was 
      confirmed in studies of MHCII-deficient mice and IFNγ-deficient mice, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that RA, a chronic autoimmune 
      arthritis, and CHIKV disease, usually a self-limiting viral arthropathy, share 
      multiple inflammatory processes. New drugs and biologic therapies being developed 
      for RA may thus find application in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides.

TI  - Determinants of antibody persistence across doses and continents after 
      single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination for Ebola virus disease: an observational 
      cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing 
      the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein is efficacious in the weeks following 
      single-dose injection, but duration of immunity is unknown. We aimed to assess 
      antibody persistence at 1 and 2 years in volunteers who received single-dose 
      rVSV-ZEBOV in three previous trials. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 
      we prospectively followed-up participants from the African and European phase 1 
      rVSV-ZEBOV trials, who were vaccinated once in 2014-15 with 300 000 (low dose) or 
      10-50 million (high dose) plaque-forming units (pfu) of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to 
      assess ZEBOV glycoprotein (IgG) antibody persistence. The primary outcome was 
      ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) measured 
      yearly by ELISA compared with 1 month (ie, 28 days) after immunisation. We report 
      GMCs up to 2 years (Geneva, Switzerland, including neutralising antibodies up to 
      6 months) and 1 year (Lambaréné, Gabon; Kilifi, Kenya) after vaccination and 
      factors associated with higher antibody persistence beyond 6 months, according to 
      multivariable analyses. Trials and the observational study were registered at 
      ClinicalTrials.gov (Geneva: NCT02287480 and NCT02933931; Kilifi: NCT02296983) and 
      the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry (Lambaréné PACTR201411000919191). 
      FINDINGS: Of 217 vaccinees from the original studies (102 from the Geneva study, 
      75 from the Lambaréné study, and 40 from the Kilifi study), 197 returned and 
      provided samples at 1 year (95 from the Geneva study, 63 from the Lambaréné, and 
      39 from the Kilifi study) and 90 at 2 years (all from the Geneva study). In the 
      Geneva group, 44 (100%) of 44 participants who had been given a high dose (ie, 
      10-50 million pfu) of vaccine and who were seropositive at day 28 remained 
      seropositive at 2 years, whereas 33 (89%) of 37 who had been given the low dose 
      (ie, 300 000 pfu) remained seropositive for 2 years (p=0·042). In participants 
      who had received a high dose, ZEBOV glycoprotein IgG GMCs decreased significantly 
      between their peak (at 1-3 months) and month 6 after vaccination in Geneva 
      (p<0·0001) and Lambaréné (p=0·0298) but not in Kilifi (p=0·5833) and subsequently 
      remained stable at all sites apart from Geneva, where GMC in those given a high 
      dose of vaccine increased significantly between 6 months and 1 year (p=0·0264). 
      Antibody persistence was similar at 1 year and at 6 months in those who had 
      received a low dose of vaccine, with lower titres among participants from the 
      Geneva study at 2 years than at 1 year after vaccination (GMC ratio 0·61, 95% CI 
      0·49-0·77; p<0·0001). In multivariable analyses, predictors of increased IgG GMCs 
      beyond 6 months included high-dose versus low-dose vaccination (Geneva p=0·0133; 
      Lambaréné p=0·008) and vaccine-related arthritis (p=0·0176), but not sex, age, or 
      baseline seropositivity (all p>0·05). Neutralising antibodies seem to be less 
      durable, with seropositivity dropping from 64-71% at 28 days to 27-31% at 6 
      months in participants from the Geneva study. INTERPRETATION: Antibody responses 
      to single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination are sustained across dose ranges and 
      settings, a key criterion in countries where booster vaccinations would be 
      impractical. FUNDING: The Wellcome Trust and Innovative Medicines Initiative 2

TI  - Complement pathway dysregulation and astrocyte alterations in Down syndrome: 
      evidence from postmortem brain tissue and iPSC-derived astrocytes.
LID - 10.1186/s40478-025-02090-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21 (T21), resulting from an extra copy 
      of chromosome 21, occurs in 1 in 700-1,000 live births. Neuroinflammation is 
      increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to DS neuropathology, although 
      its underlying drivers remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 
      available single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data from postmortem cortical 
      brains of individuals with DS and controls aged 36 years or younger, focusing 
      specifically on astrocyte-enriched clusters. This analysis revealed significant 
      alterations in complement system gene sets. To further investigate these 
      findings, we employed a human in vitro model using astrocytes differentiated from 
      urine-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from individuals 
      with DS (T21-iPSCs). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate both 
      gene expression and protein levels of secreted complement components in 
      T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes. RESULTS: snRNAseq re-analyzes identified an 
      upregulation of complement system components, including C1R, C1S, C2, C4A, C4B, 
      C5, C5AR1, C6, C8, CD59, CFI, and FCN2, and of glutamate transporters SLC1A3 
      (EAAT1/GLAST-1) and SLC1A2 (EAAT2/GLT-1) in DS astrocytes. Results from the in 
      vitro model revealed distinct phenotypic changes in T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes, 
      including enlarged cell and nuclear sizes, and enhanced glutamate uptake. 
      Elevated levels of C5aR1 and MASP1 transcripts, as well as increased C4 protein 
      secretion in culture supernatants, suggest dysregulation of the complement system 
      in DS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential contribution of 
      astrocyte-driven complement signaling to DS neuropathogenesis. While further 
      validation is needed, this work points to a candidate pathway that may serve as a 
      target for future therapeutic investigation to improve the quality of life for 
      individuals with DS.

AB  - Innate recognition systems, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), play a 
      critical role in activating host defences and proinflammatory pathways in 
      response to infection. Pathogens have developed strategies to subvert TLRs in 
      order to survive and replicate within the host. The model intracellular pathogen, 
      Francisella novicida, modulates host defences to promote survival and replication 
      in macrophages. TLR2, which recognizes bacterial lipoproteins (BLPs), is critical 
      for activating host defences and proinflammatory cytokine production in response 
      to Francisella infection. Here we show that the F. novicida protein FTN_0757 acts 
      to repress BLP production, dampening TLR2 activation. The ΔFTN_0757 mutant strain 
      induced robust TLR2-dependent cytokine production in macrophages compared with 
      wild-type bacteria, and produced increased amounts of BLPs. The deletion of one 
      BLP (FTN_1103) from ΔFTN_0757 decreased the total BLP concentration to near 
      wild-type level sand correlated with a decrease in the inductionof TLR2 
      signalling. The overproduction of BLPs also contributed to the in vivo 
      attenuation of the ΔFTN_0757 mutant, which was significantly rescued when 
      FTN_1103 was deleted. Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of 
      immune evasion by the downregulation of BLP expression to subvert TLR2 
      activation, which is likely used by numerous other intracellular bacterial 
      pathogens.

TI  - Induction of Cell Cycle and NK Cell Responses by Live-Attenuated Oral Vaccines 
      against Typhoid Fever.

AB  - The mechanisms by which oral, live-attenuated vaccines protect against typhoid 
      fever are poorly understood. Here, we analyze transcriptional responses after 
      vaccination with Ty21a or vaccine candidate, M01ZH09. Alterations in response 
      profiles were related to vaccine-induced immune responses and subsequent outcome 
      after wild-type Salmonella Typhi challenge. Despite broad genetic similarity, we 
      detected differences in transcriptional responses to each vaccine. Seven days 
      after M01ZH09 vaccination, marked cell cycle activation was identified and 
      associated with humoral immunogenicity. By contrast, vaccination with Ty21a was 
      associated with NK cell activity and validated in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cell stimulation assays confirming superior induction of an NK cell response. 
      Moreover, transcriptional signatures of amino acid metabolism in Ty21a recipients 
      were associated with protection against infection, including increased incubation 
      time and decreased severity. Our data provide detailed insight into molecular 
      immune responses to typhoid vaccines, which could aid the rational design of 
      improved oral, live-attenuated vaccines against enteric pathogens.

AB  - The biological processes of cellular decision making and differentiation involve 
      a plethora of signaling pathways and gene regulatory circuits. These networks in 
      turn exhibit a multitude of motifs playing crucial parts in regulating network 
      activity. Here we compare the topological placement of motifs in gene regulatory 
      and signaling networks and observe that it suggests different evolutionary 
      strategies in motif distribution for distinct cellular subnetworks.
