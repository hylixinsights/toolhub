A better understanding of the mechanisms that \r\n      regulate CD8(+) T-cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve \r\n      immunotherapies that restore function in exhausted CD8(+) T cells. Here we \r\n      identify a population of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells that proliferate after \r\n      blockade of the PD-1 inhibitory pathway in mice chronically infected with \r\n      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells \r\n      expressed the PD-1 inhibitory receptor, but also expressed several costimulatory \r\n      molecules such as ICOS and CD28. This CD8(+) T-cell subset was characterized by a \r\n      unique gene signature that was related to that of CD4(+) T follicular helper \r\n      (T(FH)) cells, CD8(+) T cell memory precursors and haematopoietic stem cell \r\n      progenitors, but that was distinct from that of CD4(+) T(H)1 cells and CD8(+) \r\n      terminal effectors. This CD8(+) T-cell population was found only in lymphoid \r\n      tissues and resided predominantly in the T-cell zones along with naive CD8(+) T \r\n      cells. These PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells resembled stem cells during chronic LCMV \r\n      infection, undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally \r\n      exhausted CD8(+) T cells that were present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid \r\n      tissues. The proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost exclusively from \r\n      this CD8(+) T-cell subset. Notably, the transcription factor TCF1 had a \r\n      cell-intrinsic and essential role in the generation of this CD8(+) T-cell subset. \r\n      These findings provide a better understanding of T-cell exhaustion and have \r\n      implications in the optimization of PD-1-directed immunotherapy in chronic \r\n      infections and cancer.\r\nFAU - Im, Se Jin\r\nAU  - Im SJ\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Hashimoto, Masao\r\nAU  - Hashimoto M\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Gerner, Michael Y\r\nAU  - Gerner MY\r\nAD  - Lymphocyte Biology Section, Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of \r\n      Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, \r\n      Maryland 20892-0421, USA.\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, \r\n      Washington 98109, USA.\r\nFAU - Lee, Junghwa\r\nAU  - Lee J\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Kissick, Haydn T\r\nAU  - Kissick HT\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nAD  - Department of Urology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia \r\n      30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Burger, Matheus C\r\nAU  - Burger MC\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Shan, Qiang\r\nAU  - Shan Q\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa \r\n      City, Iowa 52242, USA.\r\nFAU - Hale, J Scott\r\nAU  - Hale JS\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Lee, Judong\r\nAU  - Lee J\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Nasti, Tahseen H\r\nAU  - Nasti TH\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Sharpe, Arlene H\r\nAU  - Sharpe AH\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, \r\n      Massachusetts 02115, USA.\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts \r\n      02115, USA.\r\nFAU - Freeman, Gordon J\r\nAU  - Freeman GJ\r\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.\r\nFAU - Germain, Ronald N\r\nAU  - Germain RN\r\nAD  - Lymphocyte Biology Section, Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of \r\n      Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, \r\n      Maryland 20892-0421, USA.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Xue, Hai-Hui\r\nAU  - Xue HH\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa \r\n      City, Iowa 52242, USA.\r\nAD  - Interdisciplinary Immunology Graduate Program, Carver College of Medicine, \r\n      University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.\r\nFAU - Ahmed, Rafi\r\nAU  - Ahmed R\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory \r\n      University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P01 AI080192/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI112579/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI121080/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI030048/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01 AI030048/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20160802\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Nature\r\nJT  - Nature\r\nJID - 0410462\r\nRN  - 0 (CD28 Antigens)\r\nRN  - 0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha)\r\nRN  - 0 (Hnf1a protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Icos protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)\r\nRN  - 0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nCIN - Nature. 2016 Sep 15;537(7620):312-314. doi: 10.1038/nature19428.

Vaccination perturbs \r\n      these networks, triggering specific pathways to induce cellular and humoral \r\n      immunity. Systems vaccinology studies have generated vast data sets describing \r\n      the genes related to vaccination, motivating the use of new approaches to \r\n      identify patterns within the data. Here, we describe a framework called Network \r\n      Vaccinology to explore the structure and function of biological networks \r\n      responsible for vaccine-induced immunity. We demonstrate how the principles of \r\n      graph theory can be used to identify modules of genes, proteins, and metabolites \r\n      that are associated with innate and adaptive immune responses. Network \r\n      vaccinology can be used to assess specific and shared molecular mechanisms of \r\n      different types of vaccines, adjuvants, and routes of administration to direct \r\n      rational design of the next generation of vaccines.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It remained to be determined why \r\n      diabetic individuals with uncontrolled glucose levels are more prone to develop \r\n      the severe form of COVID-19. The molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 \r\n      infection and what determines the onset of the cytokine storm found in severe \r\n      COVID-19 patients are unknown. Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched \r\n      immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central \r\n      role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon \r\n      infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. \r\n      The infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production, which induces stabilization \r\n      of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and consequently promotes glycolysis. \r\n      HIF-1α-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by SARS-CoV-2 infection directly \r\n      inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival. Targeting HIF-1ɑ may \r\n      have great therapeutic potential for the development of novel drugs to treat \r\n      COVID-19.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Excessive neutrophil extracellular \r\n      traps (NETs) are critical players in the development of organ failure during \r\n      sepsis. Therefore, interventions targeting NET release would likely effectively \r\n      prevent NET-based organ injury associated with this disease. Herein, we \r\n      demonstrate that the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is active in \r\n      neutrophils from septic humans and mice and plays a crucial role in NET release. \r\n      Inhibition of GSDMD with disulfiram or genic deletion abrogated NET formation, \r\n      reducing multiple organ dysfunction and sepsis lethality. Mechanistically, we \r\n      demonstrate that during sepsis, activation of the caspase-11/GSDMD pathway \r\n      controls NET release by neutrophils during sepsis. In summary, our findings \r\n      uncover a novel therapeutic use for disulfiram and suggest that GSDMD is a \r\n      therapeutic target to improve sepsis treatment.\r\nCI  - © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.\r\nFAU - Silva, Camila Meirelles S\r\nAU  - Silva CMS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8185-4435\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Wanderley, Carlos Wagner S\r\nAU  - Wanderley CWS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2100-9963\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Veras, Flavio P\r\nAU  - Veras FP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6222-4064\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nFAU - Sonego, Fabiane\r\nAU  - Sonego F\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nFAU - Nascimento, Daniele C\r\nAU  - Nascimento DC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0620-339X\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, Augusto V\r\nAU  - Gonçalves AV\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1577-3677\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents, Ribeirao \r\n      Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martins, Timna V\r\nAU  - Martins TV\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Cólon, David F\r\nAU  - Cólon DF\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6911-4765\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Borges, Vanessa F\r\nAU  - Borges VF\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Brauer, Verônica S\r\nAU  - Brauer VS\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Damasceno, Luis Eduardo A\r\nAU  - Damasceno LEA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2833-9244\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Silva, Katiussia P\r\nAU  - Silva KP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9606-082X\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu, Sao Paulo, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Toller-Kawahisa, Juliana E\r\nAU  - Toller-Kawahisa JE\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nFAU - Batah, Sabrina S\r\nAU  - Batah SS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9694-3489\r\nAD  - Pathology and Legal Medicine and.\r\nFAU - Souza, Ana Letícia J\r\nAU  - Souza ALJ\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3594-1209\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Monteiro, Valter S\r\nAU  - Monteiro VS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1785-6713\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Antônio Edson R\r\nAU  - Oliveira AER\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8783-9009\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nFAU - Donate, Paula B\r\nAU  - Donate PB\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8422-8894\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases.\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, and.\r\nFAU - Zoppi, Daniel\r\nAU  - Zoppi D\r\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil;

Tpex cells respond to blockade of the \r\n      inhibitory receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and regulation of their \r\n      differentiation is critical for immunotherapies. Tpex cells highly express \r\n      inducible costimulator (ICOS), but how ICOS modulates PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells is \r\n      not clear. During chronic infection, intrinsic ICOS deficiency increased number \r\n      and quality of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. Loss of ICOS potentiated activity \r\n      of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and memory-like features of \r\n      Tpex cells. ICOS-deficient Tpex cells were poised to generate effecor-like cells \r\n      with improved survival and cytokine production. ICOS-ligand (ICOSL) blockade \r\n      expanded effector-like PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells, reduced viral load, and improved \r\n      response to PD-1 blockade. Similarly, in a mouse model of hepatocellular \r\n      carcinoma, ICOS inhibition enhanced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and \r\n      tumor control by PD-1 blockade. Overall, we show that sustained ICOS \r\n      costimulation limits CD8(+) T cell responses during chronic antigen exposure.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Our \r\n      findings revealed a platelet and adhesion-related blood transcriptional signature \r\n      on day 7 that predicted the longevity of the antibody response, suggesting a \r\n      potential role for platelets in modulating antibody response durability. As \r\n      platelets originate from megakaryocytes, we explored the effect of thrombopoietin \r\n      (TPO)-mediated megakaryocyte activation on antibody response longevity. We found \r\n      that TPO administration enhanced the durability of vaccine-induced antibody \r\n      responses. TPO-activated megakaryocytes also promoted survival of human \r\n      bone-marrow plasma cells through integrin β1/β2-mediated cell-cell interactions, \r\n      along with survival factors APRIL and the MIF-CD74 axis. Using machine learning, \r\n      we developed a classifier based on this platelet-associated signature, which \r\n      predicted antibody response longevity across six vaccines from seven independent \r\n      trials, highlighting a conserved mechanism for vaccine durability.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

Extracellular adenosine \r\n      triggers immunosuppressive signaling via the A2a receptor (A2aR). Sepsis \r\n      survivors develop persistent immunosuppression with increased risk of recurrent \r\n      infections. We utilized the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis and \r\n      subsequent infection to assess the role of adenosine in post-sepsis immune \r\n      suppression. A2aR-deficient mice showed improved resistance to post-sepsis \r\n      infections. Sepsis expanded a subset of CD39(hi) B cells and elevated \r\n      extracellular adenosine, which was absent in mice lacking CD39-expressing B \r\n      cells. Sepsis-surviving B cell-deficient mice were more resistant to secondary \r\n      infections. Mechanistically, metabolic reprogramming of septic B cells increased \r\n      production of ATP, which was converted into adenosine by CD39 on plasmablasts. \r\n      Adenosine signaling via A2aR impaired macrophage bactericidal activity and \r\n      enhanced interleukin-10 production.

Two recent advances are beginning to illuminate such \r\n      mechanisms: realization of the pivotal role of the innate immune system in \r\n      sensing microbes and stimulating adaptive immunity, and advances in systems \r\n      biology. Recent studies have used systems biology approaches to obtain a global \r\n      picture of the immune responses to vaccination in humans. This has enabled the \r\n      identification of early innate signatures that predict the immunogenicity of \r\n      vaccines, and identification of potentially novel mechanisms of immune \r\n      regulation. Here, we review these advances and critically examine the potential \r\n      opportunities and challenges posed by systems biology in vaccine development.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

C5a/C5aR1 signaling increased locally in \r\n      the lung, especially in neutrophils of critically ill patients with COVID-19 \r\n      compared with patients with influenza infection, as well as in the lung tissue of \r\n      K18-hACE2 Tg mice (Tg mice) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Genetic and pharmacological \r\n      inhibition of C5aR1 signaling ameliorated lung immunopathology in Tg-infected \r\n      mice. Mechanistically, we found that C5aR1 signaling drives neutrophil \r\n      extracellular traps-dependent (NETs-dependent) immunopathology. These data \r\n      confirm the immunopathological role of C5a/C5aR1 signaling in COVID-19 and \r\n      indicate that antagonists of C5aR1 could be useful for COVID-19 treatment.\r\nFAU - Silva, Bruna M\r\nAU  -

Recent findings have delineated the differentiation pathway of CD8 T \r\n      cells in accordance with the progenitor-progeny relationship of TCF1(+) stem-like \r\n      and Tim-3(+)TCF1(-) more differentiated T cells. Here, we investigated the \r\n      characteristics of stem-like and differentiated CD8 T cells isolated from several \r\n      murine tumor models and human lung cancer samples in terms of phenotypic and \r\n      transcriptional features as well as their location compared to virus-specific CD8 \r\n      T cells in the chronically lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected \r\n      mice. We found that CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in both murine and \r\n      human tumors exhibited overall similar phenotypic and transcriptional \r\n      characteristics compared to corresponding subsets in the spleen of chronically \r\n      infected mice. Moreover, stem-like CD8 TILs exclusively responded and produced \r\n      effector-like progeny CD8 T cells in vivo after antigenic restimulation, \r\n      confirming their lineage relationship and the proliferative potential of \r\n      stem-like CD8 TILs. Most importantly, similar to the preferential localization of \r\n      PD-1(+) stem-like CD8 T cells in T cell zones of the spleen during chronic LCMV \r\n      infection, we found that the PD-1(+) stem-like CD8 TILs in lung cancer samples \r\n      are preferentially located not in the tumor parenchyma but in tertiary lymphoid \r\n      structures (TLSs). The stem-like CD8 T cells are present in TLSs located within \r\n      and at the periphery of the tumor, as well as in TLSs closely adjacent to the \r\n      tumor parenchyma. These findings suggest that TLSs provide a protective niche to \r\n      support the quiescence and maintenance of stem-like CD8 T cells in the tumor.\r\nFAU - Im, Se Jin\r\nAU  - Im SJ\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.\r\nAD  -

This comprehensive \r\n      review examines the immunomodulatory effects of antidepressant medications, \r\n      revealing their significant impact on Th1/Th2 cytokine balance beyond their \r\n      classical neurotransmitter actions. Clinical data show that diverse \r\n      antidepressant classes consistently demonstrate immunomodulatory properties that \r\n      extend beyond their classical neurotransmitter effects. These medications reduce \r\n      pro-inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory \r\n      cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), effects particularly relevant for treatment-resistant \r\n      cases with elevated baseline inflammation. The therapeutic potential of these \r\n      immunoregulatory effects is supported by emerging interventions, including \r\n      low-dose IL-2 immunotherapy, vagus nerve stimulation, and microbiota-targeted \r\n      therapies, which show promise for specific depression subtypes. Importantly, \r\n      these approaches appear most effective when guided by inflammatory biomarkers, \r\n      suggesting a path toward personalized treatment strategies. By integrating \r\n      findings from clinical studies and translational research, this work establishes \r\n      immune modulation as a fundamental component of antidepressant action. The review \r\n      provides a framework for developing next-generation treatments that target \r\n      neuroimmune pathways in MDD, with particular emphasis on practical applications \r\n      for treatment-resistant cases. These insights bridge the gap between \r\n      neuropharmacology and clinical psychiatry, offering new therapeutic possibilities \r\n      for patients with inflammation-associated depression.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), a scaffold \r\n      protein involved in diverse cellular processes, interacts with various membrane \r\n      and extracellular matrix molecules, influencing tumor biology. Herein, we \r\n      investigate the impact of PrP(C) expression on GBM. METHODS: To address this \r\n      goal, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate PrP(C) knockout (KO) \r\n      glioblastoma cell lines, enabling detailed loss-of-function studies. Bulk RNA \r\n      sequencing followed by differentially expressed gene and pathway enrichment \r\n      analyses between U87 or U251 PrP(C)-wild-type (WT) cells and PrP(C)-knockout (KO) \r\n      cells were used to identify pathways regulated by PrP(C). Immunofluorescence \r\n      assays were used to evaluate cellular morphology and protein distribution. For \r\n      assessment of protein levels, Western blot and flow cytometry assays were \r\n      employed. Transwell and growth curve assays were used to determine the impact of \r\n      loss-of-PrP(C) in GBM invasiveness and proliferation, respectively. Single-cell \r\n      RNA sequencing analysis of data from patient tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas \r\n      (TCGA) and the Broad Institute of Single-Cell Data Portal were used to evaluate \r\n      the correspondence between our in vitro results and patient samples. RESULTS: \r\n      Transcriptome analysis of PrP(C)-KO GBM cell lines revealed altered expression of \r\n      genes associated with crucial tumor progression pathways, including migration, \r\n      proliferation, and stemness. These findings were corroborated by assays that \r\n      revealed impaired invasion, migration, proliferation, and self-renewal in \r\n      PrP(C)-KO GBM cells, highlighting its critical role in sustaining tumor growth. \r\n      Notably, loss-of-PrP(C) disrupted the expression and localization of key stemness \r\n      markers, particularly CD44. Additionally, the modulation of PrP(C) levels through \r\n      CD44 overexpression further emphasizes their regulatory role in these processes. \r\n      CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish PrP(C) as a modulator of essential \r\n      molecules on the cell surface of GSCs, highlighting its potential as a \r\n      therapeutic target for GBM.\r\nCI  - © 2024.

Analyzing 79 patients, we found distinct gene expression \r\n      patterns between acute YF, other viral infections, and the milder YF-17D vaccine \r\n      infection. We identified a critical role for low-density, immature neutrophils in \r\n      severe outcomes, marked by the downregulation of genes essential for neutrophil \r\n      migration and maturation, such as PADI4, CSF3R, and ICAM1, in deceased patients. \r\n      Our study also revealed complex interactions among inflammation-related genes, \r\n      including increased CXCL10 and IL1R2 expression and decreased IL-1b expression in \r\n      the acute phase. The diminished expression of HLA class II genes indicates \r\n      impaired antigen presentation. These findings highlight the delicate balance of \r\n      immune responses in YF pathogenesis and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic \r\n      and diagnostic advancements.\r\nCI  - © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\r\nFAU -

bqae148 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1210/endocr/bqae148 [doi]\r\nAB  - Thyroid autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease, \r\n      are significantly more prevalent in women than in men, suggesting underlying \r\n      biological differences in immune system function and regulation between sexes. \r\n      Plasma B cells are crucial in autoimmunity due to their role in producing \r\n      antibodies targeting self-antigens, but their presence in the thyroids of women \r\n      without clinical autoimmune diseases remains largely unexplored. This study \r\n      investigates the infiltration of plasma B cells in female thyroids specifically \r\n      excluding those with any clinical signs of autoimmune diseases. Using bulk \r\n      RNA-seq analysis, we identified significant sex differences in gene expression \r\n      profiles, particularly in genes associated with plasma B cells. Single-cell \r\n      RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analyses further revealed that the \r\n      CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling axis plays a pivotal role in recruiting and organizing \r\n      plasma B cells within the thyroid tissue. These findings suggest that the \r\n      inherent presence of plasma B cells in the female thyroid, driven by CXCL13, may \r\n      contribute to the higher risk of developing autoimmune thyroid diseases in women. \r\n      Our study provides new insights into the immune landscape of the thyroid and \r\n      underscores the importance of understanding sex-specific differences in immune \r\n      cell distribution and function.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2024.

We investigated the \r\n      transcriptome of 128,421 single-cells of 36 brain metastases, originating from a \r\n      variety of primary tumors, including melanoma, breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, \r\n      and renal cancers. Our aim was to identify common molecular factors across these \r\n      tumors, shedding light on key interactions that facilitate tumor establishment in \r\n      the brain. We specifically focused on the dynamics of the blood-tumor barrier and \r\n      its effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Our analysis decoded \r\n      complex cell-cell communications, emphasizing the crucial role of astrocytes in \r\n      the tumor microenvironment (TME). This provided insights into how these \r\n      interactions impact the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier and contribute to \r\n      the development of brain metastases. We identified the VEGFA, SEMA3, and SPP1 \r\n      pathways as key regulators in brain metastasis, affecting vascular permeability \r\n      and cellular dynamics. Spatial transcriptome analysis confirmed our findings and \r\n      linked these pathways to TME enrichment. The pronounced expression of VEGFA by \r\n      cancer cells suggests a significant activation of angiogenic pathways, \r\n      influencing vascular responses and the intricate architecture of brain tissue. \r\n      The interplay of these signaling pathways underlines the complexity of molecular \r\n      interactions that define the microenvironment of brain metastases.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The speed and scale of omics analysis have \r\n      increased exponentially in the past decades, and it is now easier and faster to \r\n      generate large amounts of biological data. However, extracting meaningful \r\n      information from this “sea of data” remains a major challenge. The field of \r\n      integrative biology utilizes a holistic approach to integrate multilayer \r\n      biological data. In this chapter, we introduce concepts and techniques for the \r\n      analysis of single-layer omics data and for integrating multilayer omics datasets \r\n      to extract meaningful and relevant biological insights. Integrative biology is a \r\n      promising approach for the study of a wide range of human diseases. We also \r\n      highlight some current challenges in the field, such as the need for more \r\n      specialized and interpretable methods, while increasing the accessibility of \r\n      integrative analysis for the scientific community.\r\nCI  - Copyright: The Authors.\r\nFED - Husi, Holger\r\nED  - Husi H\r\nAD  - Division of Biomedical Science, University of the Highlands and Islands, UK\r\nFAU - Urbanski, Alysson H\r\nAU  - Urbanski AH\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil\r\nFAU - Araujo, José D\r\nAU  - Araujo JD\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil\r\nFAU - Creighton, Rachel\r\nAU  - Creighton R\r\nAD  - Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur/USP, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPT  - Book Chapter\r\nPL  - Brisbane (AU)\r\nOTO - NLM\r\nOT  - integrative biology\r\nOT  - multi-omics\r\nOT  - proteogenomics\r\nOT  - single-layer high-throughput data\r\nOT  - systems biology\r\nEDAT- 2019/11/21 00:00\r\nCRDT- 2019/11/21 00:00\r\nAID - NBK550336 [bookaccession]\r\nAID - 10.15586/computationalbiology.2019.ch2 [doi]\r\n\r\nPMID- 40749304\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20251008\r\nLR  - 20251008\r\nIS  - 1573-2509 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0920-9964 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 284\r\nDP  - 2025 Oct\r\nTI  - Low-dose methotrexate as a potential treatment for schizophrenia via astrocytic \r\n      and neuroimmune modulation.\r\nPG  - 67-76\r\nLID - S0920-9964(25)00273-7 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.schres.2025.07.022 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The reduced life expectancy observed in individuals with \r\n      schizophrenia (SCZ) underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. \r\n      Emerging evidence suggests that astrocytic dysfunction and immune-inflammatory \r\n      processes contribute to SCZ pathophysiology. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX), an \r\n      established immunomodulatory drug used for non-neurological conditions, \r\n      demonstrated antipsychotic potential in early SCZ. However, the underlying \r\n      mechanisms remain unknown. AIMS: This study aimed to identify molecular targets \r\n      of MTX within SCZ-relevant pathways, focusing on astrocytic and neuroimmune \r\n      networks using in silico bioinformatics analysis and a rodent model for SCZ. \r\n      METHODS: In silico analysis: A bioinformatics-based approach was employed, \r\n      integrating cognitive computing-generated knowledge graphs, modular co-expression \r\n      analysis, and gene-drug interaction databases with a machine learning-based \r\n      text-mining tool. Rodent model: The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801-induced mouse \r\n      model for SCZ was used to assess MTX's therapeutic potential, compared to \r\n      clozapine. Behavioural outcomes (sociability and cognition) and astrocytic \r\n      reactivity (GFAP expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) were \r\n      evaluated. RESULTS: In silico: MTX preferentially targeted hub genes within \r\n      astrocyte and NFκB modules. In astrocytes, MTX modulated NT5E, a key regulator of \r\n      adenosine metabolism. In the NFκB module, MTX interacted with IL-6 and STAT3, \r\n      both involved in immune regulation. Rodent model: MK-801 administration impaired \r\n      sociability and cognition, accompanied by increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in \r\n      the prelimbic mPFC, both of which were prevented by MTX. The neuroimmunomodulator \r\n      effect of MTX was comparable to clozapine in both the in silico and rodent model. \r\n      CONCLUSION: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the potential \r\n      antipsychotic-like effects of low-dose MTX in SCZ, involving astrocytic \r\n      modulation and immune regulation. Further experimental medicine studies in \r\n      clinical populations stratified by astrocytic and neuroinflammatory biomarkers \r\n      are warranted to validate these findings.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Individual \r\n      heterogeneity of leukocyte response to VLA-4 on natalizumab-mediated blockade may \r\n      underlie disparities in treatment efficacy. Here we use a high-content cell \r\n      imaging (HCI) pipeline to profile the in vitro effects of natalizumab on \r\n      VLA-4-stimulated PBMCs from MS patients prior to natalizumab treatment. \r\n      Unsupervised clustering of image data partially discriminates non-responder MS \r\n      patients based on morphology, F-actin organization and signaling-related features \r\n      in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, through a random forest approach, treatment \r\n      response can be predicted with a performance of 92% for a discovery cohort and \r\n      88% for a validation cohort. Unfavorable treatment response is associated with a \r\n      distinct actin remodeling response of natalizumab-exposed CD8(+) T cells and a \r\n      residual ability of these cells to spread on VCAM-1. Our study thus unveils that \r\n      CD8(+) T cells from individual MS patients display heterogeneous susceptibility \r\n      to natalizumab in vitro and highlights the potential of HCI-based pretreatment \r\n      monitoring to assist individualized treatment prescription.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

e185\r\nLID - 10.1017/ash.2023.451 [doi]\r\nLID - e185\r\nAB  - Despite the considerable advances in the last years, the health information \r\n      systems for health surveillance still need to overcome some critical issues so \r\n      that epidemic detection can be performed in real time. For instance, despite the \r\n      efforts of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) to make COVID-19 data available \r\n      during the pandemic, delays due to data entry and data availability posed an \r\n      additional threat to disease monitoring. Here, we propose a complementary \r\n      approach by using electronic medical records (EMRs) data collected in real time \r\n      to generate a system to enable insights from the local health surveillance system \r\n      personnel. As a proof of concept, we assessed data from São Caetano do Sul City \r\n      (SCS), São Paulo, Brazil. We used the \"fever\" term as a sentinel event. Regular \r\n      expression techniques were applied to detect febrile diseases. Other specific \r\n      terms such as \"malaria,\" \"dengue,\" \"Zika,\" or any infectious disease were \r\n      included in the dictionary and mapped to \"fever.\" Additionally, after \r\n      \"tokenizing,\" we assessed the frequencies of most mentioned terms when fever was \r\n      also mentioned in the patient complaint. The findings allowed us to detect the \r\n      overlapping outbreaks of both COVID-19 Omicron BA.1 subvariant and Influenza A \r\n      virus, which were confirmed by our team by analyzing data from private \r\n      laboratories and another COVID-19 public monitoring system. Timely information \r\n      generated from EMRs will be a very important tool to the decision-making process \r\n      as well as research in epidemiology. Quality and security on the data produced is \r\n      of paramount importance to allow the use by health surveillance systems.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2023.\r\nFAU - Sampaio, Vanderson S\r\nAU  - Sampaio VS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7307-8851\r\nAD  -

Integrative mapping of preexisting influenza immune landscapes predicts vaccine \r\n      response.\r\nLID - 10.1172/JCI189300 [doi]\r\nLID - e189300\r\nAB  - BACKGROUNDPredicting individual vaccine responses is a substantial public health \r\n      challenge. We developed Immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework for \r\n      systems vaccinologists to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across \r\n      diverse vaccination settings, beyond traditional assessments.METHODSUsing a \r\n      comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) dataset from 244 Gambian \r\n      children, Immunaut integrated prevaccination and postvaccination humoral, \r\n      mucosal, cellular, and transcriptomic data. Through advanced modeling, our \r\n      framework provided a holistic, systems-level view of LAIV-induced \r\n      immunity.RESULTSThe analysis identified 3 distinct immunophenotypic profiles \r\n      driven by baseline immunity: (a) CD8+ T cell responders with strong preexisting \r\n      immunity boosting memory T cell responses; (b) mucosal responders with prior \r\n      influenza A virus immunity developing robust mucosal IgA and subsequent influenza \r\n      B virus seroconversion; and (c) systemic, broad influenza A virus responders \r\n      starting from immune naivety who mounted broad systemic antibody responses. \r\n      Pathway analysis revealed how preexisting immune landscapes and baseline \r\n      features, such as mucosal preparedness and cellular support, quantitatively \r\n      dictate vaccine outcomes.CONCLUSIONOur findings emphasize the power of \r\n      integrative, predictive frameworks for advancing precision vaccinology. The \r\n      Immunaut framework is a valuable resource for deciphering vaccine response \r\n      heterogeneity and can be applied to optimize immunization strategies across \r\n      diverse populations and vaccine platforms.FUNDINGWellcome Trust (110058/Z/15/Z); \r\n      Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-004222); HIC-Vac Consortium; NIAID (R21 \r\n      AI151917); NIAID CEIRR Network (75N93021C00045).\r\nFAU -

However, the development of vaccines against global pandemics such as \r\n      HIV, malaria and tuberculosis has been obstructed by several challenges. A major \r\n      challenge is the lack of knowledge about the correlates and mechanisms of \r\n      protective immunity. Recent advances in the application of systems biological \r\n      approaches to analyse immune responses to vaccination in humans are beginning to \r\n      yield new insights about mechanisms of vaccine immunity, and to define molecular \r\n      signatures, induced rapidly after vaccination, that correlate with and predict \r\n      vaccine induced immunity. Here, we review these advances and discuss the \r\n      potential of this systems vaccinology approach in defining novel correlates of \r\n      protection in clinical trials, and in infection-induced 'experimental challenge \r\n      models' in humans.\r\nCI  - © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Such analysis, \r\n      however, requires substantial knowledge about programming languages and/or \r\n      bioinformatics skills. We present webCEMiTool, a unique online tool that performs \r\n      comprehensive modular analyses in a fully automated manner. The webCEMiTool not \r\n      only identifies co-expression gene modules but also performs several functional \r\n      analyses on them. In addition, webCEMiTool integrates transcriptomic data with \r\n      interactome information (i.e., protein-protein interactions) and identifies \r\n      potential hubs on each network. The tool generates user-friendly html reports \r\n      that allow users to search for specific genes in each module, as well as check if \r\n      a module contains genes overrepresented in specific pathways or altered in a \r\n      specific sample phenotype.

In this article, we survey the main \r\n      findings of the large-scale expression analysis projects that led to the \r\n      identification of antisense intronic messages and which demonstrate their \r\n      ubiquitous expression in the human genome. We review the current knowledge on \r\n      long, unspliced, intronic antisense transcripts, a new class of non-coding RNAs, \r\n      recently described by our group to be correlated with the degree of tumor \r\n      differentiation in prostate cancer, which we postulate is involved in the fine \r\n      tuning of gene expression in eukaryotes. Possible mechanisms of antisense \r\n      intronic transcript biogenesis and function in gene expression regulation are \r\n      discussed, as is their involvement in human diseases. While there is still no \r\n      conclusive evidence demonstrating a functional role for these long, intronic \r\n      antisense messages, the far-reaching implications of their existence for the \r\n      mechanisms regulating gene expression certainly warrant further experimentation.\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Louro, Rodrigo\r\nAU  - Louro R\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - OMICS\r\nJT  - Omics : a journal of integrative biology\r\nJID - 101131135\r\nRN  - 0 (Chromatin)\r\nRN  - 0 (DNA, Complementary)\r\nRN  - 0 (MicroRNAs)\r\nRN  - 0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Antisense)\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)\r\nRN  - 0 (Ubiquitin)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Alternative Splicing\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Cell Differentiation\r\nMH  - Chromatin/metabolism\r\nMH  - DNA Methylation\r\nMH  - DNA, Complementary/metabolism\r\nMH  - Expressed Sequence Tags\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation\r\nMH  - *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic\r\nMH  - Genome\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Introns\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - MicroRNAs/chemistry\r\nMH  - Models, Genetic\r\nMH  - Multigene Family\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry\r\nMH  - Phenotype\r\nMH  - Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism\r\nMH  - RNA Interference\r\nMH  - *RNA, Antisense\r\nMH  - RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/metabolism\r\nMH  - Transcription, Genetic\r\nMH  - Ubiquitin/metabolism\r\nRF  - 60\r\nEDAT- 2005/04/05 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2005/09/02 09:00\r\nCRDT- 2005/04/05 09:00\r\nPHST- 2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - 10.1089/omi.2005.9.2 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - OMICS. 2005 Spring;9(1):2-12. doi: 10.1089/omi.2005.9.2.\r\n\r\nPMID- 41106359\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20251017\r\nLR  - 20251017\r\nIS  - 1097-4172 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0092-8674 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 188\r\nIP  - 21\r\nDP  - 2025 Oct 16\r\nTI  - Exploring Latin America one cell at a time.\r\nPG  - 5790-5796\r\nLID - S0092-8674(25)01081-5 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.013 [doi]\r\nAB  - Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics are revolutionizing science.

As the global population ages and comorbidities increase, there is \r\n      a heightened concern about this infection. We investigated the immunological \r\n      responses of older adults to pneumococcal-controlled human infection by analyzing \r\n      the cellular composition and gene expression in the nasal mucosa. Our comparative \r\n      analysis with data from a concurrent study in younger adults revealed distinct \r\n      gene expression patterns in older individuals susceptible to colonization, \r\n      highlighted by neutrophil activation and elevated levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. \r\n      Unlike younger adults challenged with pneumococcus, older adults did not show \r\n      recruitment of monocytes into the nasal mucosa following nasal colonization. \r\n      However, older adults who were protected from colonization showed increased \r\n      degranulation of cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, both before and after \r\n      pneumococcal challenge. These findings suggest age-associated cellular changes, \r\n      in particular enhanced mucosal inflammation, that may predispose older adults to \r\n      pneumococcal colonization.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Although this method of vaccination has had success in \r\n      providing protection in animals, these vaccines suffer from low immunogenicity in \r\n      humans. Questions remain over the molecular mechanism of DNA vaccination, the \r\n      best ways in which to safely increase vaccine reactogenecity, and what biomarkers \r\n      can be used as correlates of protection. Systems vaccinology, which utilizes \r\n      modern experimental and computational approaches to provide an integrated view of \r\n      the vaccination process, offers the potential to answer these questions. In this \r\n      review we discuss the current tools utilized in systems vaccinology, the ways in \r\n      which they have and can be applied to DNA vaccinology, and challenges faced in \r\n      the field.\r\nFAU - Lever, Melissa\r\nAU  - Lever M\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, 05508, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silveira, Eduardo L\r\nAU  - Silveira EL\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, 05508, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, 05508, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20160920\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Curr Issues Mol Biol\r\nJT  - Current issues in molecular biology\r\nJID - 100931761\r\nRN  - 0 (Vaccines, DNA)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Biotechnology/*trends\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Systems Biology\r\nMH  - *Vaccines, DNA\r\nEDAT- 2016/09/21 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2017/02/17 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2016/09/21 06:00\r\nPHST- 2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2017/02/17 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - cimb.022.001 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.21775/cimb.022.001 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Curr Issues Mol Biol. 2017;22:1-16. doi: 10.21775/cimb.022.001.

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 induces upregulation and \r\n      activation of human caspase-4/CASP4 (mouse caspase-11/CASP11), and this process \r\n      contributes to NLRP3 activation. In vivo infections performed in transgenic hACE2 \r\n      humanized mice, deficient or sufficient for Casp11, indicate that hACE2 Casp11-/- \r\n      mice were protected from disease development, with the increased pulmonary \r\n      parenchymal area, reduced clinical score of the disease, and reduced mortality. \r\n      Assessing human samples from fatal cases of COVID-19, we found that CASP4 was \r\n      expressed in patient lungs and correlated with the expression of inflammasome \r\n      components and inflammatory mediators, including CASP1, IL1B, IL18, and IL6. \r\n      Collectively, our data establish that CASP4/11 promotes NLRP3 activation and \r\n      disease pathology, revealing a possible target for therapeutic interventions for \r\n      COVID-19.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2023.

Analysis of 37 genomes revealed 5,169 potential genes \r\n      (approximately 4.3 Mbp) of phage origin, and at least 50% had no function \r\n      assigned or are nonessential to phage biology. Some phytopathogens have \r\n      transcriptionally active prophage genes under conditions that mimic plant \r\n      infection, suggesting an association between plant disease and prophage \r\n      transcriptional modulation. The role of prophages within genomes for cell biology \r\n      varies. For pathogens such as Pectobacterium, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and \r\n      Streptomyces, involvement of prophage in disease symptoms has been demonstrated. \r\n      In Xylella and Xanthomonas, prophage activity is associated with genome \r\n      rearrangements and strain differentiation. For other pathogens, prophage roles \r\n      are yet to be established. This review integrates available information in a \r\n      unique interface ( http://propnav.esalq.usp.br ) that may be assessed to improve \r\n      research in prophage biology and its association with genome evolution and \r\n      pathogenicity.\r\nFAU - Varani, Alessandro M\r\nAU  - Varani AM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Genética (LGN), Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, \r\n      Universidade de São Paulo, 13418-900 Piracicaba/SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Monteiro-Vitorello, Claudia Barros\r\nAU  - Monteiro-Vitorello CB\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Van Sluys, Marie-Anne\r\nAU  - Van Sluys MA\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20130524\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Annu Rev Phytopathol\r\nJT  - Annual review of phytopathology\r\nJID - 0372373\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Bacteria/*pathogenicity/*virology\r\nMH  - Databases, Genetic\r\nMH  - Evolution, Molecular\r\nMH  - Genes, Viral/*genetics\r\nMH  - Genome, Bacterial/*genetics\r\nMH  - Host-Pathogen Interactions\r\nMH  - Phylogeny\r\nMH  - Plant Diseases/*microbiology\r\nMH  - Plants/microbiology\r\nMH  - Prophages/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology\r\nMH  - Recombination, Genetic\r\nMH  - Virulence\r\nEDAT- 2013/06/04 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2013/12/20 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2013/06/04 06:00\r\nPHST- 2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]\r\nAID - 10.1146/annurev-phyto-081211-173010 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:429-51. doi: 10.1146/annurev-phyto-081211-173010. \r\n      Epub 2013 May 24.\r\n\r\nPMID- 37523305\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20230802\r\nLR  - 20230803\r\nIS  - 2050-084X (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2050-084X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 12\r\nDP  - 2023 Jul 31\r\nTI  - SARS-CoV-2 uses CD4 to infect T helper lymphocytes.\r\nLID - 10.7554/eLife.84790 [doi]\r\nLID - e84790\r\nAB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of \r\n      a major global outbreak of respiratory tract disease known as Coronavirus Disease \r\n      2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects mainly lungs and may cause several \r\n      immune-related complications, such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm, which \r\n      are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality. The \r\n      mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction \r\n      is still not fully understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4(+) \r\n      T helper cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, and is present in blood and \r\n      bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We \r\n      demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 \r\n      molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells. This \r\n      leads to impaired CD4 T cell function and may cause cell death. \r\n      SARS-CoV-2-infected T helper cells express higher levels of IL-10, which is \r\n      associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may contribute to a poor immune response \r\n      in COVID-19 patients.\r\nCI  - © 2023, Brunetti, Davanzo, de Moraes et al.\r\nFAU -

Dysregulated transcription factors (TFs) and genes have been implicated \r\n      in glioma progression, yet these tumors' overall structure of gene regulatory \r\n      networks (GRNs) remains undefined. We analyzed transcriptional data from 989 \r\n      primary gliomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome \r\n      Atlas (CGGA) to address this. GRNs were reconstructed using the RTN package which \r\n      identifies regulons-sets of genes regulated by a common TF based on co-expression \r\n      and mutual information. Regulon activity was evaluated through Gene Set \r\n      Enrichment Analysis. Elastic net regularization and Cox regression identified 31 \r\n      and 32 prognostic genes in the TCGA and CGGA datasets, respectively, with 11 \r\n      genes overlapping, many of which are associated with neural development and \r\n      synaptic processes. GAS2L3, HOXD13, and OTP demonstrated the strongest \r\n      correlations with survival outcomes among these. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of \r\n      201,986 cells revealed distinct expression patterns for these genes in glioma \r\n      subpopulations, particularly oligoprogenitor cells. This study uncovers key GRNs \r\n      and prognostic genes in gliomas, offering new insights into tumor biology and \r\n      potential therapeutic targets.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

This study explored the associations \r\n      between autoantibodies (AABs), particularly those targeting G protein-coupled \r\n      receptors (GPCRs) and renin‒angiotensin system (RAS) molecules, and the clinical \r\n      manifestations of COVID-19. Using a cross-sectional analysis of 244 individuals, \r\n      we applied multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, and \r\n      multinomial regression to examine the relationships between AAB levels and key \r\n      symptoms. Significant correlations were identified between specific AABs and \r\n      symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Notably, anti-AGTR1 \r\n      antibodies, which contribute to endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation, a \r\n      process reversed by losartan, have emerged as strong predictors of core symptoms. \r\n      AAB levels increased with symptom accumulation, peaking in patients exhibiting \r\n      all four key symptoms. These findings highlight the role of AABs, particularly \r\n      anti-AGTR1 antibodies, in determining symptom severity and suggest their \r\n      involvement in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including vascular complications.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

The immune system changes with age, with innate \r\n      and adaptive cell components becoming increasingly dysfunctional. As such, \r\n      vaccine responses in the elderly are impaired in ways that differ depending on \r\n      the type of vaccine (e.g., live attenuated, polysaccharide, conjugate, or \r\n      subunit) and the mediators of protection (e.g., antibody and/or T cell). The \r\n      rapidly progressing field of systems biology has been shown to be useful in \r\n      predicting immunogenicity and offering insights into potential mechanisms of \r\n      protection in young adults. Future application of systems biology to vaccination \r\n      in the elderly may help to identify gene signatures that predict suboptimal \r\n      responses and help to identify more accurate correlates of protection. Moreover, \r\n      the identification of specific defects may be used to target novel vaccination \r\n      strategies that improve efficacy in elderly populations.\r\nFAU - Duraisingham, Sai S\r\nAU  - Duraisingham SS\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, \r\n      954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Rouphael, Nadine\r\nAU  - Rouphael N\r\nFAU - Cavanagh, Mary M\r\nAU  - Cavanagh MM\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Goronzy, Jorg J\r\nAU  - Goronzy JJ\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R37DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - HHSN266200700006C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090019/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37AI48638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01AI50025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPL  - Germany\r\nTA  - Curr Top Microbiol Immunol\r\nJT  - Current topics in microbiology and immunology\r\nJID - 0110513\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Aged\r\nMH  - Aging/*immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Lymphocyte Activation\r\nMH  - Systems Biology/*methods\r\nMH  - *Vaccination\r\nEDAT- 2012/08/21 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2013/04/19 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2012/08/21 06:00\r\nPHST- 2012/08/21 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2012/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2013/04/19 06:00 [medline]\r\nAID - 10.1007/82_2012_250 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2013;363:117-42. doi: 10.1007/82_2012_250.\r\n\r\nPMID- 32362926\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nLR  - 20240328\r\nIS  - 1678-9199 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1678-9199 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1678-9180 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 26\r\nDP  - 2020 Apr 6\r\nTI  - São Paulo School of Advanced Sciences on Vaccines: an overview.\r\nPG  - e20190061\r\nLID - 10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2019-0061 [doi]\r\nLID - e20190061\r\nAB  - Two years ago, we held an exciting event entitled the São Paulo School of \r\n      Advanced Sciences on Vaccines (SPSASV). Sixty-eight Ph.D. students, postdoctoral \r\n      fellows and independent researchers from 37 different countries met at the Mendes \r\n      Plaza Hotel located in the city of Santos, SP - Brazil to discuss the challenges \r\n      and the new frontiers of vaccinology. The SPSASV provided a critical and \r\n      comprehensive view of vaccine research from basics to the current \r\n      state-of-the-art techniques performed worldwide. For 10 days, we discussed all \r\n      the aspects of vaccine development in 36 lectures, 53 oral presentations and 2 \r\n      poster sessions. At the end of the course, participants were further encouraged \r\n      to present a model of a grant proposal related to vaccine development against \r\n      individual pathogens. Among the targeted pathogens were viruses (Chikungunya, \r\n      HIV, RSV, and Influenza), bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus \r\n      pyogenes), parasites (Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax), and the worm \r\n      Strongyloides stercoralis.

Although angiotensin-converting \r\n      enzyme 2 (ACE2) is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and enter host cells, no study \r\n      has systematically assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with \r\n      these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples from \r\n      patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 \r\n      was highly expressed in these patients compared to control individuals. This \r\n      finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of \r\n      developing severe COVID-19. Correlation and network analyses revealed many \r\n      potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to \r\n      histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. Our systems biology \r\n      approach offers a possible explanation for increased COVID-19 severity in \r\n      patients with certain comorbidities.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2020.

Systems \r\n      vaccinology can combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain \r\n      highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. \r\n      Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers \r\n      with no background in bioinformatics. Here we described the four main steps to \r\n      discover markers of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity: (1) Preparing the \r\n      data; (2) Selecting the vaccinees and relevant genes; (3) Choosing the algorithm; \r\n      (4) Blind testing your model. With the increasing number of Systems Vaccinology \r\n      datasets being generated, we expect that the accuracy and robustness of \r\n      signatures of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity will significantly \r\n      improve.\r\nFAU - Gonzalez-Dias, Patrícia\r\nAU  - Gonzalez-Dias P\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lee, Eva K\r\nAU  - Lee EK\r\nAD  - The Center for Operations Research in Medicine and HealthCare, Georgia Institute \r\n      of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nFAU - Sorgi, Sara\r\nAU  - Sorgi S\r\nAD  - Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - de Lima, Diógenes S\r\nAU  - de Lima DS\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Urbanski, Alysson H\r\nAU  - Urbanski AH\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silveira, Eduardo Lv\r\nAU  - Silveira EL\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20191223\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Hum Vaccin Immunother\r\nJT  - Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics\r\nJID - 101572652\r\nRN  - 0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *Antibodies, Bacterial\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Immunogenicity, Vaccine\r\nPMC - PMC7062420\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Systems vaccinology\r\nOT  - artificial intelligence\r\nOT  - machine learning\r\nOT  - vaccine immunogenicity\r\nOT  - vaccine reactogenicity\r\nEDAT- 2019/12/24 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/06/22 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2019/12/23\r\nCRDT- 2019/12/24 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2019/12/23 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 1697110 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1080/21645515.2019.1697110 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2020;16(2):269-276. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2019.1697110. \r\n      Epub 2019 Dec 23.\r\n\r\nPMID- 39328409\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20240927\r\nLR  - 20241007\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 15\r\nDP  - 2024\r\nTI  - The single-cell transcriptome of mTECs and CD4(+) thymocytes under adhesion \r\n      revealed heterogeneity of mTECs and a network controlled by Aire and lncRNAs.\r\nPG  - 1376655\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1376655 [doi]\r\nLID - 1376655\r\nAB  - To further understand the impact of deficiency of the autoimmune regulator (Aire) \r\n      gene during the adhesion of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to \r\n      thymocytes, we sequenced single-cell libraries (scRNA-seq) obtained from Aire \r\n      wild-type (WT) (Aire(wt/wt) ) or Aire-deficient (Aire(wt/mut) ) mTECs cocultured \r\n      with WT single-positive (SP) CD4(+) thymocytes. Although the libraries differed \r\n      in their mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiles, indicating that mTECs \r\n      were heterogeneous in terms of their transcriptome, UMAP clustering revealed that \r\n      both mTEC lines expressed their specific markers, i.e., Epcam, Itgb4, Itga6, and \r\n      Casp3 in resting mTECs and Ccna2, Pbk, and Birc5 in proliferative mTECs. Both \r\n      cocultured SP CD4(+) thymocytes remained in a homogeneous cluster expressing the \r\n      Il7r and Ccr7 markers. Comparisons of the two types of cocultures revealed the \r\n      differential expression of mRNAs that encode transcription factors (Zfpm2, Satb1, \r\n      and Lef1), cell adhesion genes (Itgb1) in mTECs, and Themis in thymocytes, which \r\n      is associated with the regulation of positive and negative selection. At the \r\n      single-cell sequencing resolution, we observed that Aire acts on both Aire WT and \r\n      Aire-deficient mTECs as an upstream controller of mRNAs, which encode \r\n      transcription factors or adhesion proteins that, in turn, are \r\n      posttranscriptionally controlled by lncRNAs, for example, Neat1, Malat1, Pvt1, \r\n      and Dancr among others. Under Aire deficiency, mTECs dysregulate the expression \r\n      of MHC-II, CD80, and CD326 (EPCAM) protein markers as well as metabolism and cell \r\n      cycle-related mRNAs, which delay the cell cycle progression. Moreover, when \r\n      adhered to mTECs, WT SP CD4(+) or CD8(+) thymocytes modulate the expression of \r\n      cell activation proteins, including CD28 and CD152/CTLA4, and the expression of \r\n      cellular metabolism mRNAs. These findings indicate a complex mechanism through \r\n      which an imbalance in Aire expression can affect mTECs and thymocytes during \r\n      adhesion.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2024 Monteiro, Duarte, Machado, Mascarenhas, Palma, García, Nakaya, \r\n      Cunha, Donadi and Passos.\r\nFAU - Monteiro, Cíntia J\r\nAU  - Monteiro CJ\r\nAD  - Molecular Immunogenetics Group, Department of Genetics, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Duarte, Max J\r\nAU  - Duarte MJ\r\nAD  - Molecular Immunogenetics Group, Department of Genetics, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Machado, Mayara Cristina V\r\nAU  - Machado MCV\r\nAD  - Molecular Immunogenetics Group, Department of Genetics, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Mascarenhas, Romário S\r\nAU  - Mascarenhas RS\r\nAD  - Molecular Immunogenetics Group, Department of Genetics, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Palma, Patrícia V Bonini\r\nAU  - Palma PVB\r\nAD  - Blood Center of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - García, Henry D Mogollón\r\nAU  - García HDM\r\nAD  - Institute of Biology, Campinas State University (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Research Institute, Albert Einstein Israeli Hospital, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cunha, Thiago M\r\nAU  - Cunha TM\r\nAD  - Center for Research in Inflammatory Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, \r\n      Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Donadi, Eduardo A\r\nAU  - Donadi EA\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Passos, Geraldo A\r\nAU  - Passos GA\r\nAD  - Molecular Immunogenetics Group, Department of Genetics, Ribeirão Preto Medical \r\n      School, University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Basic and Oral Biology, Ribeirão Preto School of Dentistry, \r\n      University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Center for Cell-Based Therapy in Dentistry, Ribeirão Preto School of Dentistry, \r\n      University of São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20240826\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)\r\nRN  - 0 (AIRE Protein)\r\nRN  - 0 (Transcription Factors)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - *AIRE Protein\r\nMH  - *Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - *Thymocytes/metabolism/immunology/cytology\r\nMH  - *Cell Adhesion\r\nMH  - *Transcriptome\r\nMH  - *Epithelial Cells/metabolism/immunology\r\nMH  - Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Single-Cell Analysis\r\nMH  - Gene Regulatory Networks\r\nMH  - CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Coculture Techniques\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nPMC - PMC11425717\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Aire\r\nOT  - cell adhesion\r\nOT  - long noncoding RNAs\r\nOT  - medullary thymic epithelial cells\r\nOT  - single-cell transcriptome\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.

The resulting risks of immunosuppression or immune hyperactivation \r\n      leading to increased Adverse Events (AEs) and altered antibody responses are \r\n      concerns that have been addressed in the present manuscript. METHODS: Children \r\n      aged 1-12 years living in Gabon received either rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (ERVEBO®) vaccine \r\n      or the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (VZV). The concentration of rVSVΔG \r\n      vector in blood and saliva, the occurrence of AEs up to day 28; the \r\n      anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP and anti-VZV IgG antibody titres, neutralising and avidity \r\n      functions of anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP by day 365; were assessed in serum. \r\n      (PACTR202005733552021) FINDINGS: In the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, 70% and 7% of \r\n      children had >0 copies/ml of rVSVΔG respectively in plasma by day 3 and in saliva \r\n      by day 14 after vaccination, with no detection on day 28. Significantly higher \r\n      but transient AEs occurred in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group. Both vaccines induced \r\n      seroconversion on day 28 and sustainable IgG antibody titres by day 365. Avidity \r\n      and neutralisation functions of the anti-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP antibodies peaked at day \r\n      28 and were maintained by day 365. INTERPRETATION: The replication and shedding \r\n      do not affect the favourable risk-benefit balance of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in \r\n      children.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

We demonstrate the critical role of uric \r\n      acid (UA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), in triggering \r\n      immunogenicity by SE adjuvants. In mice, SE adjuvants elevated DAMP levels in \r\n      draining lymph nodes. Strikingly, inhibition of UA synthesis reduced \r\n      vaccine-induced innate immunity, subsequently impairing optimal antibody and T \r\n      cell responses. In vivo treatment with UA crystals elicited partial adjuvant \r\n      effects. In vitro stimulation with UA crystals augmented the activation of \r\n      dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and altered multiple pathways in these cells, \r\n      including inflammation and antigen presentation in DCs and cell proliferation in \r\n      B cells. In an influenza vaccine model, UA contributed to protection against \r\n      influenza viral infection. These results demonstrate the importance of DAMPs, \r\n      specifically the versatile role of UA in the immunogenicity of SE adjuvants, by \r\n      regulating DCs and B cells.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

Here, we utilized low-pass whole genome sequencing (lpWGS) with \r\n      imputation plus detailed epidemiologic risk factors and single-cell expression \r\n      quantitative loci (sceQTL) to address prior GWAS limitations. Using 947 pulmonary \r\n      tuberculosis (PTB) cases and 1807 close contact controls in the Regional \r\n      Prospective Observational Research in TB (RePORT) study in Brazil, we estimated \r\n      PTB heritability to be 47.7%. We identified 19 SNPs associated with PTB (P<5E-8) \r\n      after adjustment for major risk factors (HIV, diabetes, smoking). Seven of these \r\n      SNPs were associated with peripheral blood cell-specific sceQTLs in controls. \r\n      Specifically, SNPs cis to transcription factors ZNF717 and MAML3 were associated \r\n      with PTB disease and gene expression in monocytes, T cells, or B cells. Overall, \r\n      this study utilized lpWGS, in-depth epidemiology, and single-cell analyses to \r\n      detect population-specific genetic risk factors for PTB in Brazil. SUMMARY: \r\n      Robust correction for tuberculosis risk factors in GWAS in combination with \r\n      paired single-cell transcriptomics reveals novel genetic risk of pulmonary \r\n      tuberculosis with measurable consequences for baseline gene expression in \r\n      multiple cell types.\r\nFAU - Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A\r\nAU  - Dill-McFarland KA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1481-7065\r\nFAU - Andrade, Bruno B\r\nAU  - Andrade BB\r\nFAU - Figueiredo, Marina C\r\nAU  - Figueiredo MC\r\nFAU - Andrade, Alice M S\r\nAU  - Andrade AMS\r\nFAU - Avendaño-Rangel, Francys\r\nAU  - Avendaño-Rangel F\r\nFAU - Cordeiro-Santos, Marcelo\r\nAU  - Cordeiro-Santos M\r\nFAU - Kritski, Afrânio L\r\nAU  - Kritski AL\r\nFAU - Rolla, Valeria C\r\nAU  - Rolla VC\r\nFAU - Cubillos-Angulo, Juan M\r\nAU  - Cubillos-Angulo JM\r\nFAU - Kalams, Spyros A\r\nAU  - Kalams SA\r\nFAU - Simmons, Josh D\r\nAU  - Simmons JD\r\nFAU - Oakes, Jared M\r\nAU  - Oakes JM\r\nFAU - Avila, Jonathan Peña\r\nAU  - Avila JP\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Gangula, Rama D\r\nAU  - Gangula RD\r\nFAU - Rebeiro, Peter F\r\nAU  - Rebeiro PF\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1951-9104\r\nFAU - Amorim, Gustavo\r\nAU  - Amorim G\r\nFAU - Mallal, Simon A\r\nAU  - Mallal SA\r\nCN  - Regional Prospective Observational Research in Tuberculosis (RePORT)-Brazil \r\n      Consortium\r\nFAU - Sterling, Timothy R\r\nAU  - Sterling TR\r\nFAU - Hawn, Thomas R\r\nAU  - Hawn TR\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Preprint\r\nDEP - 20250407\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - medRxiv\r\nJT  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences\r\nJID - 101767986\r\nPMC - PMC11952600\r\nEDAT- 2025/03/31 21:17\r\nMHDA- 2025/03/31 21:18\r\nPMCR- 2025/04/14\r\nCRDT- 2025/03/31 06:30\r\nPHST- 2025/03/31 21:17 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2025/03/31 21:18 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2025/03/31 06:30 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2025/04/14 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 2025.03.13.25323932 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1101/2025.03.13.25323932 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - medRxiv [Preprint]. 2025 Apr 7:2025.03.13.25323932. doi: \r\n      10.1101/2025.03.13.25323932.\r\n\r\nPMID- 25858860\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20160711\r\nLR  - 20220311\r\nIS  - 1873-2518 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0264-410X (Print)\r\nIS  - 0264-410X (Linking)\r\nVI  - 33\r\nIP  - 40\r\nDP  - 2015 Sep 29\r\nTI  - Systems vaccinology: Enabling rational vaccine design with systems biological \r\n      approaches.\r\nPG  - 5294-301\r\nLID - S0264-410X(15)00391-6 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.072 [doi]\r\nAB  - Vaccines have drastically reduced the mortality and morbidity of many diseases. \r\n      However, vaccines have historically been developed empirically, and recent \r\n      development of vaccines against current pandemics such as HIV and malaria has \r\n      been met with difficulty. The advent of high-throughput technologies, coupled \r\n      with systems biological methods of data analysis, has enabled researchers to \r\n      interrogate the entire complement of a variety of molecular components within \r\n      cells, and characterize the myriad interactions among them in order to model and \r\n      understand the behavior of the system as a whole. In the context of vaccinology, \r\n      these tools permit exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines \r\n      induce protective immune responses. Here we review the recent advances, \r\n      challenges, and potential of systems biological approaches in vaccinology. If the \r\n      challenges facing this developing field can be overcome, systems vaccinology \r\n      promises to empower the identification of early predictive signatures of vaccine \r\n      response, as well as novel and robust correlates of protection from infection. \r\n      Such discoveries, along with the improved understanding of immune responses to \r\n      vaccination they impart, will play an instrumental role in development of the \r\n      next generation of rationally designed vaccines.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem \r\n      cells (hiPSCs) from three different healthy donors into neural stem cells (NSCs) \r\n      and floor plate progenitors (FPPs; progenitors of dopaminergic neurons) and \r\n      further performed intracellular and extracellular vesicles' (EVs) miRNA \r\n      profiling. While NSC and FPP cells differed significantly in levels of only 8 \r\n      intracellular miRNAs, their differences were more evident in the EV miRNAs with \r\n      27 differentially expressed miRNAs. Target validation of intracellular miRNAs \r\n      revealed that FPPs expressed more EXOC5 mRNA than NSCs, which is implicated in \r\n      the function of primary cilia, an essential signaling organelle in FPPs. \r\n      Moreover, we found a group of 5 miRNAs consistently enriched in EVs from these \r\n      three cell types.

To address this gap, we \r\n      developed immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework implemented as an R \r\n      package specifically designed for all systems vaccinologists seeking to analyze \r\n      and predict immunological outcomes across diverse vaccination settings. \r\n      Leveraging one of the most comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) \r\n      datasets to date - 244 Gambian children enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity \r\n      study - immunaut integrates humoral, mucosal, cellular, transcriptomic, and \r\n      microbiological parameters collected before and after vaccination, providing an \r\n      unprecedentedly holistic view of LAIV-induced immunity. Through advanced \r\n      dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling, immunaut \r\n      identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder profiles and their underlying \r\n      baseline determinants. In this study, immunaut delineated three immunophenotypes: \r\n      (1) CD8 T-cell responders, marked by strong baseline mucosal immunity and \r\n      extensive prior influenza virus exposure that boosts memory CD8 T-cell responses, \r\n      without generating influenza virus-specific antibody responses; (2) Mucosal \r\n      responders, characterized by pre-existing systemic influenza A virus immunity \r\n      (specifically to H3N2) and stable epithelial integrity, leading to potent mucosal \r\n      IgA expansions and subsequent seroconversion to influenza B virus; and (3) \r\n      Systemic, broad influenza A virus responders, who start with relatively naive \r\n      immunity and leverage greater initial viral replication to drive broad systemic \r\n      antibody responses against multiple influenza A virus variants beyond those \r\n      included in the LAIV vaccine. By integrating pathway-level analysis, \r\n      model-derived contribution scores, and hierarchical decision rules, immunaut \r\n      elucidates how distinct immunological landscapes shape each response trajectory \r\n      and how key baseline features, including pre-existing immunity, mucosal \r\n      preparedness, and cellular support, dictate vaccine outcomes. Collectively, these \r\n      findings emphasize the power of integrative, predictive frameworks to advance \r\n      precision vaccinology, and highlight immunaut as a versatile, community-available \r\n      resource for optimizing immunization strategies across diverse populations and \r\n      vaccine platforms.\r\nFAU - Hao, Stephanie\r\nAU  - Hao S\r\nAD  - Atomic lab, The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), \r\n      Boston University;

In \r\n      this work, we evaluated the existence of a common mechanism of transcription \r\n      regulation shared by protein-coding mRNAs and intronic RNAs by measuring the \r\n      effect of androgen on the transcriptional profile of a prostate cancer cell line. \r\n      RESULTS: Using a custom-built cDNA microarray enriched in intronic transcribed \r\n      sequences, we found 39 intronic non-coding RNAs for which levels were \r\n      significantly regulated by androgen exposure. Orientation-specific reverse \r\n      transcription-PCR indicated that 10 of the 13 were transcribed in the antisense \r\n      direction. These transcripts are long (0.5-5 kb), unspliced and apparently do not \r\n      code for proteins. Interestingly, we found that the relative levels of \r\n      androgen-regulated intronic transcripts could be correlated with the levels of \r\n      the corresponding protein-coding gene (asGAS6 and asDNAJC3) or with the \r\n      alternative usage of exons (asKDELR2 and asITGA6) in the corresponding \r\n      protein-coding transcripts. Binding of the androgen receptor to a putative \r\n      regulatory region upstream from asMYO5A, an androgen-regulated antisense intronic \r\n      transcript, was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. CONCLUSION: \r\n      Altogether, these results indicate that at least a fraction of naturally \r\n      transcribed intronic non-coding RNAs may be regulated by common physiological \r\n      signals such as hormones, and further corroborate the notion that the intronic \r\n      complement of the transcriptome play functional roles in the human \r\n      gene-expression program.\r\nFAU - Louro, Rodrigo\r\nAU  - Louro R\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      05508-900 São Paulo, Brazil. rolouro@iq.usp.br\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Amaral, Paulo P\r\nAU  - Amaral PP\r\nFAU - Festa, Fernanda\r\nAU  - Festa F\r\nFAU - Sogayar, Mari C\r\nAU  - Sogayar MC\r\nFAU - da Silva, Aline M\r\nAU  - da Silva AM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866751\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866752\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866753\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866754\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866755\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866756\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866757\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866758\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866759\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866760\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866761\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866762\r\nSI  - GENBANK/DQ866763\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20070130\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - BMC Biol\r\nJT  - BMC biology\r\nJID - 101190720\r\nRN  - 0 (AR protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (Androgens)\r\nRN  - 0 (MicroRNAs)\r\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Androgen)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Androgens/*physiology\r\nMH  - Base Sequence\r\nMH  - Blotting, Northern\r\nMH  - Consensus Sequence\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Introns\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - MicroRNAs/*genetics\r\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nMH  - Prostatic Neoplasms\r\nMH  - Receptors, Androgen/*genetics\r\nMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nMH  - Transcription, Genetic\r\nMH  - Tumor Cells, Cultured\r\nPMC - PMC1800835\r\nEDAT- 2007/02/01 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2007/03/06 09:00\r\nPMCR- 2007/01/30\r\nCRDT- 2007/02/01 09:00\r\nPHST- 2006/09/01 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2007/01/30 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2007/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2007/02/01 09:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2007/01/30 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 1741-7007-5-4 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1186/1741-7007-5-4 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - BMC Biol. 2007 Jan 30;5:4. doi: 10.1186/1741-7007-5-4.\r\n\r\nPMID- 40270958\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20250424\r\nLR  - 20250425\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 16\r\nDP  - 2025\r\nTI  - Integrative immunology identified interferome signatures in uveitis and systemic \r\n      disease-associated uveitis.\r\nPG  - 1509805\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509805 [doi]\r\nLID - 1509805\r\nAB  - INTRODUCTION: Uveitis accounts for up to 25% of global legal blindness and \r\n      involves intraocular inflammation, classifed as infectious or non-infectious.

METHODS: In this \r\n      study, we conducted an integrative systems biology analysis of blood \r\n      transcriptome data from 169 non-infectious uveitis patients (56 isolated uveitis, \r\n      113 systemic disease-associated uveitis) and 82 healthy controls. RESULTS: \r\n      Modular co-expression analysis identified distinct cytokine signaling networks, \r\n      emphasizing interleukin and interferon pathways. A meta-analysis revealed 110 \r\n      differentially expressed genes (metaDEGs) in isolated uveitis and 91 in systemic \r\n      disease-associated uveitis, predominantly linked to immune responses. The \r\n      Interferome database confirmed a predominance of type I and II IFN signatures in \r\n      both groups. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted inflammatory responses, \r\n      including cytokine production (IL-8, IL1-β, IFN-γ, β, and α) and toll-like \r\n      receptor signaling (TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, CD180). Principal component analysis \r\n      emphasized the IFN signature's discriminative power, particularly in systemic \r\n      disease-associated uveitis. Machine learning identified IFN-associated genes as \r\n      robust predictors, while linear discriminant analysis pinpointed CCR2, CD180, \r\n      GAPT, and PTGS2 as key risk factors in isolated uveitis and CA1, SIAH2, and PGS \r\n      in systemic disease-associated uveitis. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight \r\n      IFN-driven imune dysregulation and potential molecular targets for precision \r\n      therapies in uveitis.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Munhoz, Fonseca, Filgueiras, Dias, Nakaya, Jurisica, Ochs, \r\n      Schimke, Rizzo and Cabral-Marques.\r\nFAU - Munhoz, Danielle Dias\r\nAU  - Munhoz DD\r\nAD  - Experimental Biology Laboratory Prof. Dr. Geraldo Medeiros-Neto, Hospital \r\n      Israelita Albert Einsten, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fonseca, Dennyson Leandro M\r\nAU  - Fonseca DLM\r\nAD  - Interunit Postgraduate Program on Bioinformatics, Institute of Mathematics and \r\n      Statistics (IME), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Filgueiras, Igor Salerno\r\nAU  - Filgueiras IS\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Dias, Haroldo Dutra\r\nAU  - Dias HD\r\nAD  - Department of Neuroscience, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University \r\n      of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Experimental Biology Laboratory Prof. Dr. Geraldo Medeiros-Neto, Hospital \r\n      Israelita Albert Einsten, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Jurisica, Igor\r\nAU  - Jurisica I\r\nAD  - Division of Orthopaedics, Osteoarthritis Research Program, Schroeder Arthritis \r\n      Institute, and Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, Krembil \r\n      Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.\r\nAD  - Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, and Faculty of Dentistry, \r\n      University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\r\nAD  - Institute of Neuroimmunology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.\r\nFAU - Ochs, Hans D\r\nAU  - Ochs HD\r\nAD  - Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, \r\n      WA, United States.\r\nAD  - Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States.\r\nFAU - Schimke, Lena F\r\nAU  - Schimke LF\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Rizzo, Luiz Vicente\r\nAU  - Rizzo LV\r\nAD  - Experimental Biology Laboratory Prof. Dr. Geraldo Medeiros-Neto, Hospital \r\n      Israelita Albert Einsten, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cabral-Marques, Otavio\r\nAU  - Cabral-Marques O\r\nAD  - Interunit Postgraduate Program on Bioinformatics, Institute of Mathematics and \r\n      Statistics (IME), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Network of Immunity in Infection, Malignancy, and Autoimmunity (NIIMA), Universal \r\n      Scientific Education and Research Network, (USERN), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory of Medical \r\n      Investigation 29, University of São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20250409\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 0 (Cytokines)\r\nRN  - 9008-11-1 (Interferons)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Uveitis/immunology/genetics/etiology/diagnosis\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Cytokines/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - *Transcriptome\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - *Interferons/genetics/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Middle Aged\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Signal Transduction\r\nPMC - PMC12014655\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - blood transcriptome\r\nOT  - cytokines\r\nOT  - integrative analysis\r\nOT  - interferon-regulated genes\r\nOT  - non-infectious uveitis\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.

This \r\n      condition disrupts individuals' daily lives and contributes to increased \r\n      healthcare expenditure. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms \r\n      underlying pCHIKV-CIJD development by analyzing RNA transcripts, including small \r\n      RNAs, of whole blood from CHIKV-infected patients. By comparing patients who \r\n      evolved to pCHIKV-CIJD with those who did not, we identified molecular signatures \r\n      associated with chronification in acute and post-acute disease phases. These \r\n      molecules were primarily associated with an altered immune response regulation. \r\n      Notably, LIFR, an immune receptor that enhanced IL-6 transcription, was \r\n      down-regulated in the acute phase of pCHIKV-CIJD patients, while its inhibitor, \r\n      hsa-miR-98-5p, was up-regulated in these individuals. Other downregulated genes \r\n      include members of immune mechanisms whose impairment can lead to a reduction in \r\n      the first line of antiviral response, thereby promoting virus persistence for a \r\n      longer period in these patients. Additionally, pCHIKV-CIJD patients exhibited \r\n      reduced transcript levels of MMP8, LFT, and DDIT4, genes already implicated in \r\n      the pathological process of other types of inflammatory arthritis and seemingly \r\n      relevant for pCHIKV-CIJD development. Overall, our findings provide insights into \r\n      the early molecular mechanisms involved in the chronification and highlight \r\n      potential targets for further investigation.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells \r\n      were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As \r\n      there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to \r\n      better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on \r\n      mitochondrial function and cell metabolism. METHODS: We obtained and \r\n      characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three \r\n      PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow \r\n      cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, in situ \r\n      respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei \r\n      RNA sequencing dataset. RESULTS: We detected several differences in MS astrocytes \r\n      including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) \r\n      increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and \r\n      MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release \r\n      of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line \r\n      with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with \r\n      a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, \r\n      which have already been linked to MS. INTERPRETATION: Here we describe the \r\n      metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as \r\n      a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug \r\n      targeting assays in vitro. Our findings recapitulate several disease features \r\n      described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic \r\n      rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic \r\n      studies.

We performed single-cell \r\n      transcriptional profiling of over 500,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from \r\n      57 HIV-negative close contacts of TB cases in Brazil, including 25 individuals \r\n      who developed active disease within two years (progressors) and 32 matched \r\n      controls who remained disease-free (non-progressors). Cells were stimulated \r\n      separately with the MTB300 peptide pool or irradiated Mtb (gRV), enabling \r\n      resolution of antigen-reactive states across adaptive (CD4⁺ T-cells expressing \r\n      abundant cytokines including IFNG, TNF, and IL17F) and trained-innate lineages, \r\n      such as NK cells (producing GM-CSF, IFNG, CCL3, CCL4) and monocytes (GM-CSF, \r\n      IL12B, IL36G). Progressors exhibited early hyper-metabolic CD4⁺ T-cell programs \r\n      and proliferative NK cell signatures, whereas non-progressors preferentially \r\n      upregulated complement activation and CCL3/4-driven chemokine signaling in \r\n      monocytes. Notably, among progressors, gene expression profiles within \r\n      antigen-reactive CD4⁺ T-cells and monocytes predicted the timing of progression \r\n      to active TB. Together, these findings reveal high frequencies and functional \r\n      diversity of antigen-reactive cells in Mtb-exposed individuals and nominate \r\n      tractable immune correlates for the rational design of next-generation TB \r\n      vaccines.\r\nFAU - Penã Avila, Jonathan\r\nAU  - Penã Avila J\r\nFAU - Simmons, Joshua\r\nAU  - Simmons J\r\nFAU - Figueiredo, Marina C\r\nAU  - Figueiredo MC\r\nFAU - Turner, Megan\r\nAU  - Turner M\r\nFAU - Cordeiro-Santos, Marcelo\r\nAU  - Cordeiro-Santos M\r\nFAU - Rolla, Valeria C\r\nAU  - Rolla VC\r\nFAU - Kristki, Afranio L\r\nAU  - Kristki AL\r\nFAU - Gangula, Rama\r\nAU  - Gangula R\r\nFAU - Nochowicz, Cynthia\r\nAU  - Nochowicz C\r\nFAU - Ram, Ramesh\r\nAU  - Ram R\r\nFAU - Bailin, Samuel\r\nAU  - Bailin S\r\nFAU - Mallal, Simon\r\nAU  - Mallal S\r\nFAU - Gaudieri, Silvana\r\nAU  - Gaudieri S\r\nFAU - Alves, Eric\r\nAU  - Alves E\r\nFAU - Barreto-Duarte, Beatriz Barreto\r\nAU  - Barreto-Duarte BB\r\nFAU - Queiroz, Artur T L\r\nAU  - Queiroz ATL\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Andrade, Bruno B\r\nAU  - Andrade BB\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6833-3811\r\nFAU - Sterling, Timothy R\r\nAU  - Sterling TR\r\nFAU - Kalams, Spyros A\r\nAU  - Kalams SA\r\nCN  - RePORT-Brazil Consortium\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Preprint\r\nDEP - 20250430\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - medRxiv\r\nJT  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences\r\nJID - 101767986\r\nPMC - PMC12060959\r\nEDAT- 2025/05/09 18:34\r\nMHDA- 2025/05/09 18:35\r\nPMCR- 2025/05/08\r\nCRDT- 2025/05/09 12:42\r\nPHST- 2025/05/09 18:35 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2025/05/09 18:34 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2025/05/09 12:42 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2025/05/08 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 2025.04.29.25326433 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1101/2025.04.29.25326433 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - medRxiv [Preprint]. 2025 Apr 30:2025.04.29.25326433. doi: \r\n      10.1101/2025.04.29.25326433.\r\n\r\nPMID- 40575112\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nLR  - 20250628\r\nIS  - 1178-6469 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1178-6469 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1178-6469 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 18\r\nDP  - 2025\r\nTI  - Activation of the IDO1-GCN2-ATF4-CHOP Pathway During the Massive Generation of \r\n      Antibody-Secreting Cells in Dengue Patients Through Single-Cell Transcriptomics.\r\nPG  - 11786469251340237\r\nLID - 10.1177/11786469251340237 [doi]\r\nLID - 11786469251340237\r\nAB  - Dengue, a widespread mosquito-borne disease, annually afflicts millions globally, \r\n      posing substantial mortality risks. Preceding disease defervescence, a marked and \r\n      transient surge in antibody-secreting cell (ASC) frequency correlates with \r\n      disease severity, paralleled by heightened tryptophan degradation. Investigating \r\n      details of this process through single-cell transcriptomics from public \r\n      repositories, our data pinpoint CD14+ monocytes as principal IDO1 and IDO2 \r\n      expressors, implicating them, rather than B cells, in initiating tryptophan \r\n      metabolism. Interestingly, naive B cells exhibit altered gene expression \r\n      indicative of early impact by tryptophan deficiency before defervescence with a \r\n      potential impact on the B cell fate. Dengue-induced ASCs upregulated GCN2, PERK, \r\n      eIF2a, ATF4 genes as well as BIM and CASP-3. However, the high expression of \r\n      anti-apoptotic genes (FKBP8 [a CHOP-regulated gene], BCL-XL, BCL-2, MCL-1) allows \r\n      enhanced ASC survival. Proliferation and differentiation-related genes (eIF4EBP1, \r\n      RRM2, and HIF1a) were also upregulated in ASCs. These findings untangle how \r\n      Dengue modulates the host metabolism and B-cell responses, although further \r\n      research is needed to fully understand their implications on disease progression.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2025.\r\nFAU - Nascimento, Jéssica C\r\nAU  - Nascimento JC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8119-2750\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, André N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, UK.\r\nFAU - Akashi, Karen T\r\nAU  - Akashi KT\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo - SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silveira, Eduardo L V\r\nAU  - Silveira ELV\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8333-2884\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20250625\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Int J Tryptophan Res\r\nJT  - International journal of tryptophan research : IJTR\r\nJID - 101513378\r\nPMC - PMC12198583\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - B cells\r\nOT  - blood\r\nOT  - kynurenine\r\nOT  - tryptophan metabolism\r\nOT  - viral infection\r\nCOIS- The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \r\n      research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\r\nEDAT- 2025/06/27 06:26\r\nMHDA- 2025/06/27 06:27\r\nPMCR- 2025/06/25\r\nCRDT- 2025/06/27 04:49\r\nPHST- 2024/06/18 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2025/04/13 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2025/06/27 06:27 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2025/06/27 06:26 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2025/06/27 04:49 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2025/06/25 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1177_11786469251340237 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1177/11786469251340237 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Int J Tryptophan Res. 2025 Jun 25;18:11786469251340237. doi: \r\n      10.1177/11786469251340237. eCollection 2025.\r\n\r\nPMID- 23947360\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20140408\r\nLR  - 20241207\r\nIS  - 1600-065X (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0105-2896 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0105-2896 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 255\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2013 Sep\r\nTI  - Immunity to viruses: learning from successful human vaccines.\r\nPG  - 243-55\r\nLID - 10.1111/imr.12099 [doi]\r\nAB  - For more than a century, immunologists and vaccinologists have existed in \r\n      parallel universes. Immunologists have for long reveled in using 'model \r\n      antigens', such as chicken egg ovalbumin or nitrophenyl haptens, to study immune \r\n      responses in model organisms such as mice. Such studies have yielded many seminal \r\n      insights about the mechanisms of immune regulation, but their relevance to humans \r\n      has been questioned. In another universe, vaccinologists have relied on human \r\n      clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy, but have done little to take \r\n      advantage of such trials for studying the nature of immune responses to \r\n      vaccination. The human model provides a nexus between these two universes, and \r\n      recent studies have begun to use this model to study the molecular profile of \r\n      innate and adaptive responses to vaccination. Such 'systems vaccinology' studies \r\n      are beginning to provide mechanistic insights about innate and adaptive immunity \r\n      in humans. Here, we present an overview of such studies, with particular examples \r\n      from studies with the yellow fever and the seasonal influenza vaccines. \r\n      Vaccination with the yellow fever vaccine causes a systemic acute viral infection \r\n      and thus provides an attractive model to study innate and adaptive responses to a \r\n      primary viral challenge. Vaccination with the live attenuated influenza vaccine \r\n      causes a localized acute viral infection in mucosal tissues and induces a recall \r\n      response, since most vaccinees have had prior exposure to influenza, and thus \r\n      provides a unique opportunity to study innate and antigen-specific memory \r\n      responses in mucosal tissues and in the blood. Vaccination with the inactivated \r\n      influenza vaccine offers a model to study immune responses to an inactivated \r\n      immunogen. Studies with these and other vaccines are beginning to reunite the \r\n      estranged fields of immunology and vaccinology, yielding unexpected insights \r\n      about mechanisms of viral immunity. Vaccines that have been proven to be of \r\n      immense benefit in saving lives offer us a new fringe benefit: lessons in viral \r\n      immunology.\r\nCI  - © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Understanding the contribution of cellular \r\n      components within the tumor microenvironment is crucial for the success of \r\n      therapeutic applications. Here, we reveal the presence of perivascular \r\n      GFAP+/Plp1+ cells within the tumor microenvironment. Using in vivo inducible \r\n      Cre/loxP mediated systems, we demonstrated that these cells derive from \r\n      tissue-resident Schwann cells. Genetic ablation of endogenous Schwann cells \r\n      slowed down tumor growth and angiogenesis. Schwann cell-specific depletion also \r\n      induced a boost in the immune surveillance by increasing tumor-infiltrating \r\n      anti-tumor lymphocytes, while reducing immune-suppressor cells. In humans, a \r\n      retrospective in silico analysis of tumor biopsies revealed that increased \r\n      expression of Schwann cell-related genes within melanoma was associated with \r\n      improved survival. Collectively, our study suggests that Schwann cells regulate \r\n      tumor progression, indicating that manipulation of Schwann cells may provide a \r\n      valuable tool to improve cancer patients' outcomes.\r\nCI  - © 2022.

The cytokines IL-1B and \r\n      IL-18, as key signaling molecules in the immune system, are produced in an \r\n      inactive form and cleave to the active form by inflammasomes. In this study, we \r\n      assessed the skin, serum, peripheral mononuclear blood cell (PBMC) and lymph-node \r\n      samples of SS patients and control groups (healthy donors (HDs) and idiopathic \r\n      erythroderma (IE) nodes) to investigate the inflammatory markers IL-1B and IL-18 \r\n      at the protein and transcript expression levels, as potential markers of \r\n      inflammasome activation. Our findings showed increased IL-1B and decreased IL-18 \r\n      protein expression in the epidermis of SS patients; however, in the dermis layer, \r\n      we detected increased IL-18 protein expression. In the lymph nodes of SS patients \r\n      at advanced stages of the disease (N2/N3), we also detected an enhancement of \r\n      IL-18 and a downregulation of IL-1B at the protein level. Moreover, the \r\n      transcriptomic analysis of the SS and IE nodes confirmed the decreased expression \r\n      of IL1B and NLRP3, whereas the pathway analysis indicated a further \r\n      downregulation of IL1B-associated genes. Overall, the present findings showed \r\n      compartmentalized expressions of IL-1B and IL-18 and provided the first evidence \r\n      of their imbalance in patients with Sézary syndrome.\r\nFAU -

24-31\r\nLID - 10.1097/COH.0b013e32834dc37b [doi]\r\nAB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The use of systems biology approaches to understand and \r\n      predict vaccine-induced immunity promises to revolutionize vaccinology. For \r\n      centuries vaccines were developed empirically, with very little understanding of \r\n      the mechanisms by which they mediate protective immunity. The so-called systems \r\n      vaccinology approach employs high-throughput technologies (e.g. microarrays, \r\n      RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics) and \r\n      computational modeling to describe the complex interactions between all the parts \r\n      of immune system, with a view to elucidating new biological rules capable of \r\n      predicting the behavior of the system. RECENT FINDINGS: Systems biology \r\n      successfully applied to yellow-fever and influenza vaccines has led to the \r\n      discovery of signatures that predict vaccine immunogenicity, and promises to \r\n      advance basic immunology research by providing novel mechanistic insights about \r\n      immune regulation. However a major challenge of systems vaccinology concerns the \r\n      analyses and interpretation of the large and noisy data sets generated by \r\n      high-throughput techniques. Overcoming these issues, we envision that systems \r\n      vaccinology will have a potential impact on vaccine development, including HIV \r\n      vaccines. SUMMARY: High-throughput technologies allow the investigation of \r\n      vaccine-induced immune responses at system and molecular levels. These are \r\n      currently being used to unravel new molecular insights about the immune system, \r\n      and are on the verge of being integrated into clinical trials to enable rational \r\n      vaccine design and development.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R56 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Review\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Curr Opin HIV AIDS\r\nJT  - Current opinion in HIV and AIDS\r\nJID - 101264945\r\nRN  - 0 (AIDS Vaccines)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - AIDS Vaccines/*immunology\r\nMH  - Drug Discovery/*methods\r\nMH  - HIV/*immunology\r\nMH  - HIV Infections/*immunology\r\nMH  - High-Throughput Screening Assays\r\nMH  - *Host-Pathogen Interactions\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Systems Biology/*methods\r\nPMC - PMC3253345\r\nMID - NIHMS345475\r\nCOIS- Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2011/12/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2012/03/30 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2011/12/14 06:00\r\nPHST- 2011/12/14 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2011/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2012/03/30 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1097/COH.0b013e32834dc37b [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Curr Opin HIV AIDS. 2012 Jan;7(1):24-31. doi: 10.1097/COH.0b013e32834dc37b.\r\n\r\nPMID- 23796714\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20140718\r\nLR  - 20220318\r\nIS  - 1096-3618 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1044-5323 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1044-5323 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 25\r\nIP  - 3\r\nDP  - 2013 Oct 31\r\nTI  - Systems biological approaches to measure and understand vaccine immunity in \r\n      humans.\r\nPG  - 209-18\r\nLID - S1044-5323(13)00032-8 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.smim.2013.05.003 [doi]\r\nAB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of using systems approaches to \r\n      identify molecular signatures that can be used to predict vaccine immunity in \r\n      humans.

The past decade has \r\n      witnessed technological revolutions in the capacity to make high throughput \r\n      measurements about the behavior of genes, proteins, and cells. Such technologies \r\n      are widely used in biological research and in medicine, such as toward prognosis \r\n      and therapy response prediction in cancer patients.

However, the mechanisms of hypercoagulability and their link to \r\n      hyperinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate functions and \r\n      mechanisms of platelet activation and platelet-monocyte interactions in \r\n      inflammatory amplification during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a combination of \r\n      immunophenotyping, single-cell analysis, functional assays, and pharmacological \r\n      approaches to gain insights on mechanisms. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 \r\n      exhibited increased platelet-monocyte aggregates formation. We identified a \r\n      subset of inflammatory monocytes presenting high CD16 and low HLA-DR expression \r\n      as the subset mainly interacting with platelets during severe COVID-19. \r\n      Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated enhanced fibrinogen receptor Mac-1 \r\n      in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. Monocytes from patients with \r\n      severe COVID-19 displayed increased platelet binding and hyperresponsiveness to \r\n      P-selectin and fibrinogen with respect to tumor necrosis factor-α and \r\n      interleukin-1β secretion. Platelets were able to orchestrate monocyte responses \r\n      driving tissue factor (TF) expression, inflammatory activation, and inflammatory \r\n      cytokines secretion in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet-monocyte interactions ex \r\n      vivo and in SARS-CoV-2 infection model in vitro reciprocally activated monocytes \r\n      and platelets, inducing the heightened secretion of a wide panel of inflammatory \r\n      mediators. We identified platelet adhesion as a primary signaling mechanism \r\n      inducing mediator secretion and TF expression, whereas TF signaling played major \r\n      roles in amplifying inflammation by inducing proinflammatory cytokines, \r\n      especially tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Our data identify \r\n      platelet-induced TF expression and activity at the crossroad of coagulation and \r\n      inflammation in severe COVID-19.\r\nCI  - © 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 \r\n      people, causing </mac_aq>5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 \r\n      </mac_aq>countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly \r\n      demonstrates the potential threat </mac_aq>of respiratory viruses to human \r\n      health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive \r\n      </mac_aq>health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the \r\n      crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. \r\n      However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require \r\n      assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied. What is intriguing, \r\n      however, is the higher susceptibility of the elderly, especially individuals who \r\n      are older than 60 years of age, and have comorbidities, including hypertension, \r\n      diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to \r\n      10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not \r\n      considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible \r\n      molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be \r\n      more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main \r\n      </mac_aq>points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in \r\n      users of chronic angiotensin 1 </mac_aq>receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) \r\n      antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating \r\n      coronaviruses. We believe that these points are pivotal for a better \r\n      understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully \r\n      addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.\r\nFAU - Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann\r\nAU  - Peron JPS\r\nAD  - Laboratorio de Interacoes Neuroimunes, Departamento de Imunologia - ICB IV, \r\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, SP, BR.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder\r\nAU  - Nakaya H\r\nAD  - Plataforma Cientifica Pasteur-USP, Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, \r\n      SP, BR.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Review\r\nDEP - 20200515\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Clinics (Sao Paulo)\r\nJT  - Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)\r\nJID - 101244734\r\nRN  - 0 (Biomarkers)\r\nRN  - EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)\r\nRN  - EC 3.4.17.23 (ACE2 protein, human)\r\nRN  - EC 3.4.17.23 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Aged\r\nMH  - Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2\r\nMH  - Antibody Formation/*immunology\r\nMH  - *Antibody-Dependent Enhancement\r\nMH  - *Betacoronavirus\r\nMH  - Biomarkers/metabolism\r\nMH  - COVID-19\r\nMH  - Coronavirus Infections/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Pandemics\r\nMH  - Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/immunology/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Pneumonia, Viral/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - SARS-CoV-2\r\nMH  - Up-Regulation\r\nPMC - PMC7213670\r\nCOIS- No potential conflict of interest was reported.\r\nEDAT- 2020/05/20 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2020/05/27 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2020/05/11\r\nCRDT- 2020/05/20 06:00\r\nPHST- 2020/04/08 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/11 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - S1807-5932(22)00367-2 [pii]\r\nAID - cln_75p1 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.6061/clinics/2020/e1912 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2020;75:e1912. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2020/e1912.

Little is known about its \r\n      impact on the transcriptome of distinct human tissues. To address this, we \r\n      performed RNA sequencing of samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, \r\n      heart, lung, kidney and colon of seven individuals who succumbed to sepsis and \r\n      seven uninfected controls. We identified that the lungs and colon were the most \r\n      affected organs. While gene activation dominated, strong inhibitory signals were \r\n      also detected, particularly in the lungs. We found that septic shock is an \r\n      extremely heterogeneous disease, not only when different individuals are \r\n      investigated, but also when comparing different tissues of the same patient. \r\n      However, several pathways, such as respiratory electron transport and other \r\n      metabolic functions, revealed distinctive alterations, providing evidence that \r\n      tissue specificity is a hallmark of sepsis. Strikingly, we found evident signals \r\n      of accelerated ageing in our sepsis population.\r\nCI  - © 2023 The Authors.

Because of limited available \r\n      data, assessments of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on this \r\n      virus spread remain challenging. Using a mobility-driven transmission model, we \r\n      show that NPIs reduced the reproduction number from >3 to 1 to 1.6 in São Paulo \r\n      and Rio de Janeiro. Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a \r\n      geographically representative genomic dataset identified >100 international virus \r\n      introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76%) of the Brazilian strains \r\n      fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February and 11 \r\n      March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread \r\n      mostly locally and within state borders. After this period, despite sharp \r\n      decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban \r\n      centers that coincided with a 25% increase in average traveled distances in \r\n      national flights. This study sheds new light on the epidemic transmission and \r\n      evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and provides evidence \r\n      that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under \r\n      control in this country.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American \r\n      Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, molecular mechanisms sustaining the chronicity of \r\n      inflammation and psoriatic lesions remain elusive. Combining systematic analyses \r\n      of several transcriptomic datasets, we delineated gene signatures across human \r\n      psoriatic skin, identifying S100A9 as one of the most up-regulated genes, which \r\n      was confirmed in lesioned skin from patients with psoriasis and preclinical \r\n      psoriasiform skin inflammation models. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic \r\n      inhibition of S100A9 alleviated Aldara-induced skin inflammation. By single-cell \r\n      mapping of human psoriatic skin and bone marrow chimeric mice experiments, we \r\n      identified keratinocytes as the major source of S100A9. Mechanistically, S100A9 \r\n      induced IL-23 production by dendritic cells, driving the IL-23/type 3 immunity in \r\n      psoriasiform skin inflammation. In addition, the cutaneous IL-23/IL-17 axis \r\n      induced epidermal S100A9 expression in human and experimental psoriasis. Thus, we \r\n      showed an autoregulatory circuit between keratinocyte-derived S100A9 and \r\n      IL-23/type 3 immunity during psoriasiform inflammation, identifying a crucial \r\n      function of S100A9 in the chronification of psoriasis.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

According to their functions, ncRNAs can be grouped \r\n      into several different RNA families, which can be represented by conserved \r\n      primary sequences, secondary structures, or covariance models (CMs). CMs are very \r\n      sensitive in predicting RNA families in nucleotide sequences and have been widely \r\n      used in characterizing the repertoire of ncRNAs in organisms from all domains of \r\n      life. However, the large-scale prediction and annotation of ncRNAs require \r\n      multiple tools along the process, imposing a great obstacle for researchers with \r\n      lesser computational or bioinformatics background. StructRNAfinder emerged as an \r\n      automated tool to avoid these bottlenecks, by performing the automatic \r\n      identification and complete annotation of regulatory RNA families derived \r\n      directly from nucleotide sequences. In this chapter, we provide a complete \r\n      tutorial for both stand-alone and web server versions of StructRNAfinder. This \r\n      will help users to install the tool and to perform predictions of RNA families in \r\n      any genome or transcriptome sequences dataset.\r\nFAU - Maracaja-Coutinho, Vinicius\r\nAU  - Maracaja-Coutinho V\r\nAD  - Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y Farmacéuticas, Advanced Center for Chronic \r\n      Diseases-ACCDiS, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. \r\n      vinicius.maracaja@uchile.cl.\r\nAD  - Beagle Bioinformatics, Santiago, Chile. vinicius.maracaja@uchile.cl.\r\nAD  - Instituto Vandique, João Pessoa, Brazil. vinicius.maracaja@uchile.cl.\r\nFAU - Arias-Carrasco, Raúl\r\nAU  - Arias-Carrasco R\r\nAD  - Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y Farmacéuticas, Advanced Center for Chronic \r\n      Diseases-ACCDiS, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nAD  - Programa de Doctorado en Genómica Integrativa, Vicerrectoría de Investigación, \r\n      Universidad Mayor, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Aliaga-Tobar, Victor\r\nAU  - Aliaga-Tobar V\r\nAD  - Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y Farmacéuticas, Advanced Center for Chronic \r\n      Diseases-ACCDiS, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nAD  - Programa de Doctorado en Genómica Integrativa, Vicerrectoría de Investigación, \r\n      Universidad Mayor, Santiago, Chile.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Methods Mol Biol\r\nJT  - Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)\r\nJID - 9214969\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Untranslated)\r\nMH  - Classification\r\nMH  - Computational Biology/*methods\r\nMH  - Data Display\r\nMH  - Genome\r\nMH  - Internet\r\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Annotation\r\nMH  - RNA, Untranslated/*genetics\r\nMH  - *Software\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Covariance models\r\nOT  - Gene predictions\r\nOT  - Noncoding RNAs\r\nOT  - RNA families\r\nOT  - RNA prediction\r\nEDAT- 2019/04/26 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2019/08/10 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2019/04/26 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]\r\nAID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_2 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1962:15-27. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_2.\r\n\r\nPMID- 36577385\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20221230\r\nLR  - 20230119\r\nIS  - 2211-1247 (Electronic)\r\nVI  - 41\r\nIP  - 13\r\nDP  - 2022 Dec 27\r\nTI  - Pyruvate kinase M2 mediates IL-17 signaling in keratinocytes driving psoriatic \r\n      skin inflammation.\r\nPG  - 111897\r\nLID - S2211-1247(22)01796-X [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111897 [doi]\r\nAB  - Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinocyte \r\n      proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by IL-17. However, the \r\n      molecular mechanism through which IL-17 signaling in keratinocytes triggers skin \r\n      inflammation remains not fully understood. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a \r\n      glycolytic enzyme, has been shown to have non-metabolic functions. Here, we \r\n      report that PKM2 mediates IL-17A signaling in keratinocytes triggering skin \r\n      psoriatic inflammation. We find high expression of PKM2 in the epidermis of \r\n      psoriatic patients and mice undergoing psoriasis models. Specific depletion of \r\n      PKM2 in keratinocytes attenuates the development of experimental psoriasis by \r\n      reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Mechanistically, PKM2 \r\n      forms a complex with Act1 and TRAF6 regulating NF-κB transcriptional signaling \r\n      downstream of the IL-17 receptor. As IL-17 also induces PKM2 expression in \r\n      keratinocytes, our findings reveal a sustained signaling circuit critical for the \r\n      psoriasis-driving effects of IL-17A, suggesting that PKM2 is a potential \r\n      therapeutic target for psoriasis.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Identifying baseline \r\n      reactogenicity signatures can advance personalized vaccinology and increase our \r\n      understanding of the molecular factors associated with such adverse events. \r\n      METHODS: In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to integrate \r\n      prevaccination gene expression data with adverse events that occurred within 14 \r\n      days post-vaccination. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analyzed the expression of 144 \r\n      genes across 343 blood samples collected from participants of 4 phase I clinical \r\n      trial cohorts: Switzerland, USA, Gabon, and Kenya. Our machine learning approach \r\n      revealed 22 key genes associated with adverse events such as local reactions, \r\n      fatigue, headache, myalgia, fever, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and arthritis, \r\n      providing insights into potential biological mechanisms linked to vaccine \r\n      reactogenicity.\r\nCI  -

The stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is a \r\n      co-chaperone essential for proteostasis. STIP1 knockout causes embryonic \r\n      lethality in mice, but its precise function during embryogenesis remains poorly \r\n      understood. Here, we investigate the role of STIP1 in early development using in \r\n      silico and cell-based approaches. Single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals that \r\n      Stip1 is co-expressed with pluripotency genes in mouse embryos, suggesting a role \r\n      in stem cell maintenance. To test this, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells \r\n      (mESCs) from genetically modified mice with altered Stip1/STIP1 expression. STIP1 \r\n      depletion in mESCs decreases the expression of pluripotency markers, reduces \r\n      proliferation, and induces apoptosis and genomic instability, whereas its \r\n      overexpression enhances pluripotency markers expression, promotes proliferation, \r\n      and confers protection against cellular stress. Moreover, proteins involved in \r\n      cell cycle progression and DNA damage response are differentially regulated in \r\n      mESCs, depending on STIP1 levels. Our findings highlight STIP1 as a pivotal \r\n      regulator of the pluripotent phenotype, early embryogenesis, and cellular \r\n      resilience, advancing our understanding of proteostasis in stem cell biology and \r\n      organismal development, with potential implications for disease modeling and \r\n      regenerative medicine.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 \r\n      directly triggers hyperglycemia. Herein, we interrogated whether and how \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 causes hyperglycemia by infecting hepatocytes and increasing glucose \r\n      production. We performed a retrospective cohort study including patients that \r\n      were admitted at a hospital with suspicion of COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory \r\n      data were collected from the chart records and daily blood glucose values were \r\n      analyzed to test the hypothesis on whether COVID-19 was independently associated \r\n      with hyperglycemia. Blood glucose was collected from a subgroup of nondiabetic \r\n      patients to assess pancreatic hormones. Postmortem liver biopsies were collected \r\n      to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its transporters in hepatocytes. In \r\n      human hepatocytes, we studied the mechanistic bases of SARS-CoV-2 entrance and \r\n      its gluconeogenic effect. SARS-CoV-2 infection was independently associated with \r\n      hyperglycemia, regardless of diabetic history and beta cell function. We detected \r\n      replicating viruses in human hepatocytes from postmortem liver biopsies and in \r\n      primary hepatocytes. We found that SARS-CoV-2 variants infected human \r\n      hepatocytes in vitro with different susceptibility. SARS-CoV-2 infection in \r\n      hepatocytes yields the release of new infectious viral particles, though not \r\n      causing cell damage. We showed that infected hepatocytes increase glucose \r\n      production and this is associated with induction of PEPCK activity. Furthermore, \r\n      our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry in hepatocytes occurs partially \r\n      through ACE2- and GRP78-dependent mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates \r\n      in hepatocytes and exerts a PEPCK-dependent gluconeogenic effect in these cells \r\n      that potentially is a key cause of hyperglycemia in infected patients.\r\nFAU -

Among these \r\n      factors, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as significant players in \r\n      all areas of biology, particularly in immunology. Most of the mammalian genome is \r\n      transcribed in a highly regulated manner, generating a diversity of lncRNAs that \r\n      impact the differentiation and activation of immune cells and affect innate and \r\n      adaptive immunity. Here, we have reviewed the range of functions and mechanisms \r\n      of lncRNAs in response to infectious disease, including pathogen recognition, \r\n      interferon (IFN) response, and inflammation. We describe examples of lncRNAs \r\n      exploited by pathogenic agents during infection, which indicate that lncRNAs are \r\n      a fundamental part of the arms race between hosts and pathogens. We also discuss \r\n      lncRNAs potentially implicated in vaccine-induced immunity and present examples \r\n      of lncRNAs associated with the antibody response of subjects receiving Influenza \r\n      or Yellow Fever vaccines. Elucidating the widespread involvement of lncRNAs in \r\n      the immune system will improve our understanding of the factors affecting immune \r\n      response to different pathogenic agents, to better prevent and treat disease.\r\nCI  - © 2021 The Author(s).

It is \r\n      clinically divided into three phases: acute, post-acute and chronic. Chronic \r\n      cases correspond to 25-40% individuals and, though most of them are characterized \r\n      by long-lasting arthralgia alone, many of them exhibit persistent or recurrent \r\n      inflammatory signs that define post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory joint \r\n      disease (pCHIKV-CIJD). We aimed to identify early clinical markers of evolution \r\n      to pCHIKV-CIJD during acute and post-acute phases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL \r\n      FINDINGS: We studied a prospective cohort of CHIKF-confirmed volunteers with \r\n      longitudinal clinical data collection from symptoms onset up to 90 days, \r\n      including a 21-day visit (D21). Of 169 patients with CHIKF, 86 (50.9%) completed \r\n      the follow-up, from whom 39 met clinical criteria for pCHIKV-CIJD (45.3%). The \r\n      relative risk of chronification was higher in women compared to men (RR = 1.52; \r\n      95% CI = 1.15-1.99; FDR = 0.03). None of the symptoms or signs presented at D0 \r\n      behaved as an early predictor of pCHIKV-CIJD, while being symptomatic at D21 was \r\n      a risk factor for chronification (RR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.09-1.55; FDR = 0.03). \r\n      Significance was also observed for joint pain (RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.12-1.61; FDR \r\n      = 0.02), reported edema (RR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.44-9.06; FDR = 0.03), reported \r\n      hand and/or feet small joints edema (RR = 4.22; 95% CI = 1.51-11.78; FDR = 0.02), \r\n      and peri-articular edema observed during physical examination (RR = 2.89; 95% CI \r\n      = 1.58-5.28; FDR = 0.002). Furthermore, patients with no findings in physical \r\n      examination at D21 were at lower risk of chronic evolution (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = \r\n      0.24-0.70, FDR = 0.01). Twenty-nine pCHIKV-CIJD patients had abnormal articular \r\n      ultrasonography (90.6% of the examined). The most common findings were synovitis \r\n      (65.5%) and joint effusion (58.6%). CONCLUSION: This cohort has provided \r\n      important insights into the prognostic evaluation of CHIKF. Symptomatic sub-acute \r\n      disease is a relevant predictor of evolution to chronic arthritis with synovitis, \r\n      drawing attention to joint pain, edema, multiple articular involvement including \r\n      small hand and feet joints as risk factors for chronification beyond three \r\n      months, especially in women. Future studies are needed to accomplish the \r\n      identification of accurate and early biomarkers of poor clinical prognosis, which \r\n      would allow better understanding of the disease's evolution and improve patients' \r\n      management, modifying CHIKF burden on global public health.\r\nCI  - Copyright: © 2023 Lázari et al.

How well mouse \r\n      models recapitulate the gene expression profiles seen in humans remains \r\n      controversial. METHODS: Herein we perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis \r\n      using RNA-Seq datasets from the C57BL/6J CHIKV mouse model with datasets obtained \r\n      from adults and children acutely infected with CHIKV. RESULTS: Despite sampling \r\n      quite different tissues, peripheral blood from humans and feet from mice, gene \r\n      expression profiles were quite similar, with an overlap of up to ≈50% for \r\n      up-regulated single copy orthologue differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, \r\n      high levels of significant concordance between mouse and human were seen for \r\n      immune pathways and signatures, which were dominated by interferons, T cells and \r\n      monocyte/macrophages. Importantly, predicted responses to a series of \r\n      anti-inflammatory drug and biologic treatments also showed cogent similarities \r\n      between species. DISCUSSION: Comparative transcriptomics and subsequent pathway \r\n      analysis provides a detailed picture of how a given model recapitulates human \r\n      gene expression. Using this method, we show that the C57BL/6J CHIKV mouse model \r\n      provides a reliable and representative system in which to study CHIKV \r\n      immunopathology and evaluate new treatments.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 Bishop, Caten, Nakaya and Suhrbier.\r\nFAU - Bishop, Cameron R\r\nAU  - Bishop CR\r\nAD  - Department of Infection and Inflammation, Queensland Institute of Medical \r\n      Research, Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\r\nFAU - Caten, Felipe Ten\r\nAU  - Caten FT\r\nAD  - Pathology Advanced Translational Research Unit, Department of Pathology and \r\n      Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United \r\n      States.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Suhrbier, Andreas\r\nAU  - Suhrbier A\r\nAD  - Department of Infection and Inflammation, Queensland Institute of Medical \r\n      Research, Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\r\nAD  - Global Virus Network (GVN) Center of Excellence, Australian Infectious Disease \r\n      Research Centre, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20221212\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - Child\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - *Chikungunya Fever\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - *Chikungunya virus\r\nMH  - T-Lymphocytes\r\nPMC - PMC9791225\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - C57BL/6J\r\nOT  - Chikungunya\r\nOT  - RNA-seq\r\nOT  - arthritis\r\nOT  - bioinformatics\r\nOT  - mouse model\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2022/12/30 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2022/12/31 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2022/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2022/12/29 02:22\r\nPHST- 2022/11/08 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2022/11/25 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2022/12/29 02:22 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2022/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2022/12/31 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2022/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1092370 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Immunol. 2022 Dec 12;13:1092370. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1092370. \r\n      eCollection 2022.\r\n\r\nPMID- 36083496\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20221103\r\nLR  - 20221109\r\nIS  - 2326-6074 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2326-6066 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 10\r\nIP  - 11\r\nDP  - 2022 Nov 2\r\nTI  - PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibition Enhances Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain by \r\n      Suppressing Neuroimmune Antinociceptive Signaling.\r\nPG  - 1299-1308\r\nLID - 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-22-0003 [doi]\r\nAB  - Cytotoxic agents synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve outcomes \r\n      for patients with several cancer types. Nonetheless, a parallel increase in the \r\n      incidence of dose-limiting side effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, is often \r\n      observed. Here, we investigated the role of the programmed cell death-1 \r\n      (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis in the modulation of \r\n      paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. We found that human and mouse neural \r\n      tissues, including the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), expressed basal levels of PD-1 \r\n      and PD-L1. During the development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, an increase \r\n      in PD-L1 expression was observed in macrophages from the DRG. This effect \r\n      depended on Toll-like receptor 4 activation by paclitaxel. Furthermore, PD-L1 \r\n      inhibited pain behavior triggered by paclitaxel or formalin in mice, suggesting \r\n      that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling attenuates peripheral neuropathy development. \r\n      Consistent with this, we observed that the combined use of anti-PD-L1 plus \r\n      paclitaxel increased mechanical allodynia and chronic neuropathy development \r\n      induced by single agents. This effect was associated with higher expression of \r\n      inflammatory markers (Tnf, Il6, and Cx3cr1) in peripheral nervous tissue. \r\n      Together, these results suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enhance \r\n      paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain by suppressing PD-1/PD-L1 antinociceptive \r\n      signaling.\r\nCI  -

10.7554/eLife.74443 [doi]\r\nLID - e74443\r\nAB  - COVID-19 is a disease of dysfunctional immune responses, but the mechanisms \r\n      triggering immunopathogenesis are not established. The functional plasticity of \r\n      macrophages allows this cell type to promote pathogen elimination and \r\n      inflammation or suppress inflammation and promote tissue remodeling and injury \r\n      repair. During an infection, the clearance of dead and dying cells, a process \r\n      named efferocytosis, can modulate the interplay between these contrasting \r\n      functions. Here, we show that engulfment of SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells \r\n      exacerbates inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits the expression of \r\n      efferocytic receptors, and impairs continual efferocytosis by macrophages. We \r\n      also provide evidence supporting that lung monocytes and macrophages from severe \r\n      COVID-19 patients have compromised efferocytic capacity. Our findings reveal that \r\n      dysfunctional efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell corpses suppresses \r\n      macrophage anti-inflammation and efficient tissue repair programs and provides \r\n      mechanistic insights for the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines \r\n      and accumulation of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.\r\nCI  -

Although metabolic and immunological changes may contribute \r\n      to the increased risk for COVID-19 mortality in obese, little is known about the \r\n      impact of obesity in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed \r\n      gene expression profiles of autopsy lungs of a cohort of 14 COVID-19 patients and \r\n      4 control individuals. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their \r\n      comorbidities: hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We then \r\n      identified the molecular alterations associated with these comorbidities in \r\n      COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Patients with only hypertension showed higher levels \r\n      of inflammatory genes and B-cell related genes when compared to those with T2D \r\n      and obesity. However, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL22, and CD274 (a ligand that \r\n      binds to receptor PD1) were higher in COVID-19 patients with T2D and obesity. \r\n      Several metabolic- and immune-associated genes such as G6PD, LCK and IL10 were \r\n      significantly induced in the lungs of the obese group. CONCLUSION: Our findings \r\n      suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may exacerbate the immune response \r\n      and chronic condition in obese COVID-19 patients.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. \r\n      Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the landscape \r\n      of cell cycle alterations in COVID-19 remains primarily unexplored. Here, we \r\n      performed an integrative systems immunology analysis of publicly available \r\n      proteome and transcriptome data to characterize global changes in the cell cycle \r\n      signature of COVID-19 patients. We found significantly enriched cell \r\n      cycle-associated gene co-expression modules and an interconnected network of cell \r\n      cycle-associated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) by \r\n      integrating the molecular data of 1469 individuals (981 SARS-CoV-2 infected \r\n      patients and 488 controls [either healthy controls or individuals with other \r\n      respiratory illnesses]). Among these DEPs and DEGs are several cyclins, cell \r\n      division cycles, cyclin-dependent kinases, and mini-chromosome \r\n      maintenance proteins. COVID-19 patients partially shared the expression pattern \r\n      of some cell cycle-associated genes with other respiratory illnesses but \r\n      exhibited some specific differential features. Notably, the cell cycle signature \r\n      predominated in the patients' blood leukocytes (B, T, and natural killer cells) \r\n      and was associated with COVID-19 severity and disease trajectories. These results \r\n      provide a unique global understanding of distinct alterations in cell \r\n      cycle-associated molecules in COVID-19 patients, suggesting new putative pathways \r\n      for therapeutic intervention.\r\nCI  - © 2023 The Authors.

Of those, only one \r\n      peptide, P44 (S415-429), recognized by 68% of convalescents, presented IgG and \r\n      IgA antibody reactivity that positively correlated with nAb titers, suggesting \r\n      that this is a relevant RBD region and a potential target of IgG/IgA neutralizing \r\n      activity. DISCUSSION: This peptide is localized within the area of contact with \r\n      ACE-2 and harbors the mutation hotspot site K417 present in gamma (K417T), beta \r\n      (K417N), and omicron (K417N) variants of concern. The epitope profile of \r\n      vaccinated individuals differed from convalescents, with a more diverse \r\n      repertoire of immunodominant peptides, recognized by more than 30% of the cohort. \r\n      Noteworthy, immunodominant regions of recognition by vaccinated coincide with \r\n      mutation sites at Omicron BA.1, an important variant emerging after massive \r\n      vaccination. Together, our data show that immune pressure induced by dominant \r\n      antibody responses may favor hotspot mutation sites and the selection of variants \r\n      capable of evading humoral response.\r\nCI  -

2938-2952\r\nLID - 10.1111/bph.15789 [doi]\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Metabolic and vascular dysfunction are common features of \r\n      obesity. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates lipid metabolism and vascular \r\n      homeostasis, but whether vascular AhR are activated in obesity or have a \r\n      protective and/or harmful effects on vascular function in obesity are unknown. \r\n      Our study addresses whether AhR activation contributes to obesity-associated \r\n      vascular dysfunction and the mechanisms involved in these AhR effects. \r\n      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male AhR KO (Ahr(-/-) ) and WT mice were fed either \r\n      control or a HF (high-fat) diet for 10 weeks. Metabolic and inflammatory \r\n      parameters were measured in serum and adipose tissue. Vascular reactivity \r\n      (isometric force) was evaluated using a myography. Endothelial NOS (eNOS) and AhR \r\n      protein expression was determined by western blot, Cyp1A1 and Nos3 gene \r\n      expression by RT-PCR and.NO production was quantified by DAF fluorescence. KEY \r\n      RESULTS: HF diet increased total serum HDL and LDL, as well as vascular AhR \r\n      protein expression and proinflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue. HF diet \r\n      decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation. AhR deletion protected mice from HF \r\n      diet-induced dyslipidaemia, weight gain and inflammatory processes. HF \r\n      diet-induced endothelial dysfunction was attenuated in Ahr(-/-) mice. Vessels \r\n      from Ahr(-/-) mice exhibited a greater NO reserve. In cultured endothelial cells, \r\n      lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) a major component of LDL and oxidized LDL [oxLDL]) \r\n      reduced Nos3 gene expression and NO production. Antagonism of the AhR inhibited \r\n      LPC effects on endothelial cells and induced decreased endothelium-dependent \r\n      vasodilation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: AhR deletion attenuates HF \r\n      diet-induced dyslipidaemia and vascular dysfunction by improving eNOS/NO \r\n      signalling. Targeting AhRs may prevent obesity-associated vascular dysfunction.\r\nCI  - © 2022 The British Pharmacological Society.\r\nFAU - da Silva, Josiane Fernandes\r\nAU  - da Silva JF\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6623-7946\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bolsoni, Juliana A\r\nAU  - Bolsoni JA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6584-5299\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Costa, Rafael M\r\nAU  - da Costa RM\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Academic Unit on Health Sciences, Jataí Federal University, Jataí, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Alves, Juliano V\r\nAU  - Alves JV\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bressan, Alecsander F M\r\nAU  - Bressan AFM\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, Luiz Eduardo V\r\nAU  - Silva LEV\r\nAD  - Department of Physiology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, \r\n      Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Costa, Tiago J\r\nAU  - Costa TJ\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0780-4290\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Antonio E R\r\nAU  - Oliveira AER\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Manzato, Carla P\r\nAU  - Manzato CP\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Aguiar, Carlos A\r\nAU  - Aguiar CA\r\nAD  - Department of Physiology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, \r\n      Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fazan, Rubens Jr\r\nAU  - Fazan R Jr\r\nAD  - Department of Physiology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, \r\n      Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cunha, Fernando Q\r\nAU  - Cunha FQ\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-4755-1670\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Israelita Albert Einstein Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Carneiro, Fernando S\r\nAU  - Carneiro FS\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Tostes, Rita C\r\nAU  - Tostes RC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9446-0707\r\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20220217\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Br J Pharmacol\r\nJT  - British journal of pharmacology\r\nJID - 7502536\r\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - *Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects\r\nMH  - Endothelial Cells/metabolism\r\nMH  - Endothelium, Vascular\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Obesity/metabolism\r\nMH  - *Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Vasodilation/physiology\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - AhR\r\nOT  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptors\r\nOT  - cardiovascular diseasedyslipidaemiaendotheliumNOobesity\r\nEDAT- 2022/01/04 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2022/05/18 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2022/01/03 06:02\r\nPHST- 2021/12/01 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/29 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2021/12/02 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2022/05/18 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2022/01/03 06:02 [entrez]\r\nAID - 10.1111/bph.15789 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Br J Pharmacol. 2022 Jun;179(12):2938-2952. doi: 10.1111/bph.15789.

METHODS: We collected anonymized \r\n      location history data from over 200 malaria-infected individuals using Google \r\n      Takeout. Sickness Positioning System applies density-based clustering techniques \r\n      to this passively collected data to identify areas of elevated infection risk. \r\n      The identified hotspots were subsequently validated through field investigations. \r\n      RESULTS: Sickness Positioning System successfully pinpointed multiple areas of \r\n      increased malaria transmission risk. Field validation confirmed two previously \r\n      unrecognized mosquito breeding sites as active sources of transmission. When \r\n      compared to Brazil's federal surveillance system - which updates data annually - \r\n      Sickness Positioning System provided a more precise and timely spatial assessment \r\n      of malaria spread. CONCLUSION: Sickness Positioning System demonstrates a \r\n      cost-effective, objective, and timely method for identifying malaria transmission \r\n      hotspots. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance disease \r\n      surveillance and facilitate more targeted public health interventions.\r\nFAU - da Silva, Bernardo Maia\r\nAU  - da Silva BM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5989-1288\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Tropical Medicine, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, \r\n      Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Giddaluru, Jeevan\r\nAU  - Giddaluru J\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8043-7162\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cardozo, Lucas Esteves\r\nAU  - Cardozo LE\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3604-2299\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martins, Felipe de Mello\r\nAU  - Martins FM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1759-0698\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Tropical Medicine, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, \r\n      Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Antolini, Alinne de Paula Rodrigues\r\nAU  - Antolini APR\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6784-0675\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Tropical Medicine, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, \r\n      Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Environmental Management, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Manaus, Manaus, AM, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bargieri, Daniel Youssef\r\nAU  - Bargieri DY\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2564-3742\r\nAD  - Department of Parasitology, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimarães\r\nAU  - de Lacerda MVG\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3374-9985\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto de Pesquisa Leônidas e Maria Deane, Fiocruz Amazonas, Manaus, AM, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo\r\nAU  - Monteiro WM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0848-1940\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, \r\n      AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sampaio, Vanderson de Souza\r\nAU  - Sampaio VS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7307-8851\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Tropical Medicine, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, \r\n      Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, \r\n      AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Vigilância em Saúde do Amazonas, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Institut Pasteur de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20251208\r\nPL  - Brazil\r\nTA  - Einstein (Sao Paulo)\r\nJT  - Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)\r\nJID - 101281800\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Retrospective Studies\r\nMH  - *Malaria/transmission/epidemiology\r\nMH  - Brazil/epidemiology\r\nMH  - *Smartphone\r\nMH  - *Geographic Information Systems\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Cluster Analysis\r\nMH  - Population Surveillance/methods\r\nPMC - PMC12671644\r\nCOIS- Conflict of interest: none.\r\nEDAT- 2025/12/10 19:21\r\nMHDA- 2025/12/10 19:22\r\nPMCR- 2025/11/24\r\nCRDT- 2025/12/10 14:13\r\nPHST- 2025/04/22 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2025/09/24 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2025/12/10 19:22 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2025/12/10 19:21 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2025/12/10 14:13 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2025/11/24 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - S1679-45082025000100288 [pii]\r\nAID - einstein_journal/2025AO1826 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.31744/einstein_journal/2025AO1826 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Einstein (Sao Paulo). 2025 Dec 8;23:eAO1826. doi: \r\n      10.31744/einstein_journal/2025AO1826. eCollection 2025.\r\n\r\nPMID- 28502771\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20170711\r\nLR  - 20250530\r\nIS  - 1097-4172 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0092-8674 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0092-8674 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 169\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2017 May 18\r\nTI  - Metabolic Phenotypes of Response to Vaccination in Humans.\r\nPG  - 862-877.e17\r\nLID - S0092-8674(17)30477-4 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.cell.2017.04.026 [doi]\r\nAB  - Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts \r\n      and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its \r\n      efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal \r\n      responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of \r\n      immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated \r\n      shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, \r\n      plasmablasts, and CD4(+) T cells yet limited CD8(+) T cell and antiviral \r\n      responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, \r\n      such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and \r\n      cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine \r\n      immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and \r\n      sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol \r\n      regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and \r\n      T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human \r\n      immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms \r\n      controlling immunity to vaccination.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, these studies provide a basis for the \r\n      discovery of clinically relevant molecular pathways underlying different diseases \r\n      and conditions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use \r\n      Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery and the analysis \r\n      of co-expression modules. Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that \r\n      CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a \r\n      user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool \r\n      evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific \r\n      pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates \r\n      transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs \r\n      on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome \r\n      datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, \r\n      revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. CONCLUSION: The \r\n      CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically \r\n      implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the \r\n      discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve \r\n      publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.\r\nFAU - Russo, Pedro S T\r\nAU  - Russo PST\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Gustavo R\r\nAU  - Ferreira GR\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cardozo, Lucas E\r\nAU  - Cardozo LE\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bürger, Matheus C\r\nAU  - Bürger MC\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Arias-Carrasco, Raul\r\nAU  - Arias-Carrasco R\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Maruyama, Sandra R\r\nAU  - Maruyama SR\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Immunology, and Cell Biology, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Hirata, Thiago D C\r\nAU  - Hirata TDC\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lima, Diógenes S\r\nAU  - Lima DS\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Passos, Fernando M\r\nAU  - Passos FM\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fukutani, Kiyoshi F\r\nAU  - Fukutani KF\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Immunology, and Cell Biology, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lever, Melissa\r\nAU  - Lever M\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, João S\r\nAU  - Silva JS\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Immunology, and Cell Biology, University of São \r\n      Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Maracaja-Coutinho, Vinicius\r\nAU  - Maracaja-Coutinho V\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, 05508-900, Brazil. \r\n      hnakaya@usp.br.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 2012/19278-6/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International\r\nGR  - 2013/08216-2/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International\r\nGR  - 443719/2014-4/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e \r\n      Tecnológico/International\r\nGR  - 305985/2014-0/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e \r\n      Tecnológico/International\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20180220\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - BMC Bioinformatics\r\nJT  - BMC bioinformatics\r\nJID - 100965194\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Automation\r\nMH  - Databases, Genetic\r\nMH  - Dengue/genetics\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - *Gene Expression Regulation\r\nMH  - *Gene Regulatory Networks\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Leishmaniasis, Visceral/genetics\r\nMH  - Psoriasis/genetics\r\nMH  - Sequence Analysis, RNA\r\nMH  - *Software\r\nMH  - Transcriptome/genetics\r\nPMC - PMC5819234\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Co-expression modules\r\nOT  - Gene networks\r\nOT  - Leishmaniasis\r\nOT  - Modular analysis\r\nOT  - Transcriptomics\r\nCOIS- ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: All procedures involving humans were \r\n      approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Federal \r\n      University of Sergipe and Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa, Brazil (CONEP). \r\n      CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Not applicable.

We performed an integrative analysis of whole blood gene expression \r\n      and plasma analytes, comparing South Indian TB patients with and without DM to \r\n      diabetic and non-diabetic controls without TB. Luminex assay of plasma cytokines \r\n      and growth factors delineated a distinct biosignature in comorbid TBDM in this \r\n      cohort. Transcriptional profiling revealed elements in common with published TB \r\n      signatures from cohorts that excluded DM. Neutrophil count correlated with the \r\n      molecular degree of perturbation, especially in TBDM patients. Body mass index \r\n      and HDL cholesterol were negatively correlated with molecular degree of \r\n      perturbation. Diabetic complication pathways including several pathways linked to \r\n      epigenetic reprogramming were activated in TBDM above levels observed with DM \r\n      alone.

It has been \r\n      demonstrated that upon infection or intense liver inflammation, KCs might be \r\n      severely depleted and replaced by immature monocytic cells; however, the \r\n      mechanisms of cell death and the alterations on liver immunity against infections \r\n      deserves further investigation. We explored the impact of acute Plasmodium \r\n      infection on KC biology and on the hepatic immune response against secondary \r\n      infections. Similar to patients, infection with Plasmodium chabaudi induced acute \r\n      liver damage as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate \r\n      aminotransferase (AST) elevation. This was associated with accumulation of \r\n      hemozoin, increased of proinflammatory response and impaired bacterial and viral \r\n      clearance, which led to pathogen spread to other organs. In line with this, mice \r\n      infected with Plasmodium had enhanced mortality during secondary infections, \r\n      which was associated with increased production of mitochondrial superoxide, lipid \r\n      peroxidation and increased free iron within KCs-hallmarks of cell death by \r\n      ferroptosis. Therefore, we revealed that accumulation of iron with KCs, triggered \r\n      by uptake of circulating hemozoin, is a novel mechanism of macrophage depletion \r\n      and liver inflammation during malaria, providing novel insights on host \r\n      susceptibility to secondary infections. Malaria can cause severe liver damage, \r\n      along with depletion of liver macrophages, which can predispose individuals to \r\n      secondary infections and enhance the chances of death.\r\nCI  - © 2022.

An approximate timeline \r\n      on these developments and their global impact is still lacking. We conducted a \r\n      scoping review on the contribution of SysBio and AI analysis to SC research and \r\n      therapy development based on literature published in PubMed between 2000 and \r\n      2024. We identified an 8 to 10-fold increase in research output related to all 3 \r\n      search terms between 2000 and 2021, with a 10-fold increase in AI-related \r\n      production since 2010. Use of SysBio and AI still predominates in preclinical \r\n      basic research with increasing use in clinically oriented translational medicine \r\n      since 2010. SysBio- and AI-related research was found all over the globe, with \r\n      SysBio output led by the (US, n = 1487), (UK, n = 1094), Germany (n = 355), The \r\n      Netherlands (n = 339), Russia (n = 215), and France (n = 149), while for \r\n      AI-related research the US (n = 853) and UK (n = 258) take a strong lead, \r\n      followed by Switzerland (n = 69), The Netherlands (n = 37), and Germany (n = 19). \r\n      The US and UK are most active in SCs publications related to AI/ML and AI/DL. The \r\n      prominent use of SysBio in ESC research was recently overtaken by prominent use \r\n      of AI in iPSC and MSC research. This study reveals the global evolution and \r\n      growing intersection among AI, SysBio, and SC research over the past 2 decades, \r\n      with substantial growth in all 3 fields and exponential increases in AI-related \r\n      research in the past decade.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2024.

Uncovering this process is fundamental to \r\n      improving immunotherapy and designing novel therapeutic approaches. In this \r\n      study, we show that polycomb repressive complex 1 subunit chromobox (Cbx)4 favors \r\n      effector CTL differentiation in a murine model. Cbx4 deficiency in CTLs induced a \r\n      transcriptional signature of memory cells and increased the memory CTL population \r\n      during acute viral infection. It has previously been shown that besides binding \r\n      to H3K27me3 through its chromodomain, Cbx4 functions as a small ubiquitin-like \r\n      modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase in a SUMO-interacting motifs (SIM)-dependent way. \r\n      Overexpression of Cbx4 mutants in distinct domains showed that this protein \r\n      regulates CTL differentiation primarily in an SIM-dependent way and partially \r\n      through its chromodomain. Our data suggest a novel role of a polycomb group \r\n      protein Cbx4 controlling CTL differentiation and indicated SUMOylation as a key \r\n      molecular mechanism connected to chromatin modification in this process.\r\nCI  -

Both innate and adaptive responses are \r\n      deemed to be involved in vaccine-induced protection, yet the mechanisms are not \r\n      fully elucidated. A global transcriptomic approach was used to profile the blood \r\n      host-response in 51 healthy volunteers enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial. \r\n      Signatures of the host responses were investigated assessing the enrichment in \r\n      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of specific \"blood transcription modules\" \r\n      (BTM). Comparison of gene-expression levels showed that vaccination produces a \r\n      peak of 5469 DEGs at day one, representing 38.6% of the expressed genes. Out of \r\n      346 BTMs, 144 were significantly affected by vaccination. Innate immunity \r\n      pathways were induced from day 1 to day 14. At days 2 and 3, neutrophil modules \r\n      were downregulated and complement-related modules upregulated. T-cell and \r\n      cell-cycle associated modules were upregulated at days 7 and 14, while at day 28, \r\n      no modules remained activated. At day 14, a direct correlation was observed \r\n      between ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific antibody titres and activation of seven BTMs, \r\n      including two related to B-cell activation and B cell receptor signalling. \r\n      Transcriptomic analysis identified an rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP-induced signature and \r\n      demonstrated a direct correlation of blood transcriptomic changes with ZEBOV \r\n      glycoprotein-specific antibody titres.\r\nFAU - Santoro, Francesco\r\nAU  - Santoro F\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3052-3518\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Donato, Alessia\r\nAU  - Donato A\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Lucchesi, Simone\r\nAU  - Lucchesi S\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3545-7433\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Sorgi, Sara\r\nAU  - Sorgi S\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8305-4095\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Gerlini, Alice\r\nAU  - Gerlini A\r\nAD  - Microbiotec srl, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Haks, Marielle C\r\nAU  - Haks MC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7538-1800\r\nAD  - Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 Leiden, \r\n      The Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Ottenhoff, Tom H M\r\nAU  - Ottenhoff THM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3706-3403\r\nAD  - Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 Leiden, \r\n      The Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Gonzalez-Dias, Patricia\r\nAU  - Gonzalez-Dias P\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6434-3841\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Consortium, Vsv-Ebovac\r\nAU  - Consortium VE\r\nFAU - Consortium, Vsv-Eboplus\r\nAU  - Consortium VE\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-USP, São Paulo 05508-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Huttner, Angela\r\nAU  - Huttner A\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of \r\n      Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nAD  - Infectious Diseases Service, Geneva University Hospitals, 1205 Geneva, \r\n      Switzerland.\r\nFAU - Siegrist, Claire-Anne\r\nAU  - Siegrist CA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7984-8669\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of \r\n      Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nAD  - World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Vaccine Immunology, Faculty of \r\n      Medicine, University of Geneva, 1200 Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nFAU - Medaglini, Donata\r\nAU  - Medaglini D\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nFAU - Pozzi, Gianni\r\nAU  - Pozzi G\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (LAMMB), Department of \r\n      Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 115842/Innovative Medicines Initiative/\r\nGR  - 116068/Innovative Medicines Initiative/\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20210120\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Vaccines (Basel)\r\nJT  - Vaccines\r\nJID - 101629355\r\nPMC - PMC7908976\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Ebolavirus Disease\r\nOT  - VSV-ZEBOV\r\nOT  - live viral vector\r\nOT  - recombinant VSV\r\nOT  - transcriptomics\r\nOT  - vaccine\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflict of interest.

However, such combination remains \r\n      an unexplored area of great interest, given the increasing number of patients \r\n      affected. In the present study, we aimed to develop a preclinical DUAL \r\n      (alcohol-associated liver disease plus metabolic-associated fatty liver disease) \r\n      model in mice. C57BL/6 mice received 10% vol/vol alcohol in sweetened drinking \r\n      water in combination with a Western diet for 10, 23, and 52 weeks (DUAL model). \r\n      Animals fed with DUAL diet elicited a significant increase in body mass index \r\n      accompanied by a pronounced hypertrophy of adipocytes, hypercholesterolemia, and \r\n      hyperglycemia. Significant liver damage was characterized by elevated plasma \r\n      alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, extensive \r\n      hepatomegaly, hepatocyte enlargement, ballooning, steatosis, hepatic cell death, \r\n      and compensatory proliferation. Notably, DUAL animals developed lobular \r\n      inflammation and advanced hepatic fibrosis. Sequentially, bridging cirrhotic \r\n      changes were frequently observed after 12 months. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis \r\n      indicated that dysregulated molecular pathways in DUAL mice were similar to those \r\n      of patients with steatohepatitis. Conclusion: Our DUAL model is characterized by \r\n      obesity, glucose intolerance, liver damage, prominent steatohepatitis and \r\n      fibrosis, as well as inflammation and fibrosis in white adipose tissue. \r\n      Altogether, the DUAL model mimics all histological, metabolic, and transcriptomic \r\n      gene signatures of human advanced steatohepatitis, and therefore serves as a \r\n      preclinical tool for the development of therapeutic targets.\r\nCI  - © 2021 The Authors.

157\r\nLID - 10.1186/s12920-020-00806-w [doi]\r\nLID - 157\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The use of noninvasive techniques to determine paternity prenatally \r\n      is increasing because it reduces the risks associated with invasive procedures. \r\n      Current methods, based on SNPs, use the analysis of at least 148 markers, on \r\n      average. METHODS: To reduce the number of regions, we used microhaplotypes, which \r\n      are chromosomal segments smaller than 200 bp containing two or more SNPs. Our \r\n      method employs massively parallel sequencing and analysis of microhaplotypes as \r\n      genetic markers. We tested 20 microhaplotypes and ascertained that 19 obey \r\n      Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and are independent, and data from the 1000 Genomes \r\n      Project were used for population frequency and simulations. RESULTS: We performed \r\n      simulations of true and false paternity, using the 1000 Genomes Project data, to \r\n      confirm if the microhaplotypes could be used as genetic markers. We observed that \r\n      at least 13 microhaplotypes should be used to decrease the chances of false \r\n      positives. Then, we applied the method in 31 trios, and it was able to correctly \r\n      assign the fatherhood in cases where the alleged father was the real father, \r\n      excluding the inconclusive results. We also cross evaluated the mother-plasma \r\n      duos with the alleged fathers for false inclusions within our data, and we \r\n      observed that the use of at least 15 microhaplotypes in real data also decreases \r\n      the false inclusions. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we demonstrated that \r\n      microhaplotypes can be used to determine prenatal paternity by using only 15 \r\n      regions and with admixtures of DNA.\r\nFAU - Wang, Jaqueline Yu Ting\r\nAU  - Wang JYT\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Toxicological Analyzes, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Whittle, Martin R\r\nAU  - Whittle MR\r\nAD  - Genomic Engenharia Molecular Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Puga, Renato David\r\nAU  - Puga RD\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Yambartsev, Anatoly\r\nAU  - Yambartsev A\r\nAD  - Statistics Department, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fujita, André\r\nAU  - Fujita A\r\nAD  - Department of Computer Science, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Toxicological Analyzes, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. hnakaya@usp.br.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 2012/19278-6/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International\r\nGR  - 2018/21934-5/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20201023\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - BMC Med Genomics\r\nJT  - BMC medical genomics\r\nJID - 101319628\r\nRN  - 0 (Genetic Markers)\r\nRN  - 9007-49-2 (DNA)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - DNA/*analysis/genetics\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - *Genetic Markers\r\nMH  - Genetic Testing\r\nMH  - *Haplotypes\r\nMH  - High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Noninvasive Prenatal Testing/*methods\r\nMH  - *Paternity\r\nMH  - Pilot Projects\r\nMH  - *Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide\r\nMH  - Pregnancy\r\nPMC - PMC7584091\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Microhaplotype\r\nOT  - Noninvasive\r\nOT  - Prenatal\r\nOT  - Probability of paternity\r\nOT  - Single nucleotide polymorphism\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\r\nEDAT- 2020/10/25 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/05/11 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2020/10/23\r\nCRDT- 2020/10/24 05:22\r\nPHST- 2020/09/10 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2020/10/07 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2020/10/24 05:22 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2020/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/10/23 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1186/s12920-020-00806-w [pii]\r\nAID - 806 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1186/s12920-020-00806-w [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - BMC Med Genomics. 2020 Oct 23;13(1):157. doi: 10.1186/s12920-020-00806-w.\r\n\r\nPMID- 35269470\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20220408\r\nLR  - 20220826\r\nIS  - 2073-4409 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2073-4409 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 11\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2022 Mar 1\r\nTI  - Severe COVID-19 Shares a Common Neutrophil Activation Signature with Other Acute \r\n      Inflammatory States.\r\nLID - 10.3390/cells11050847 [doi]\r\nLID - 847\r\nAB  - Severe COVID-19 patients present a clinical and laboratory overlap with other \r\n      hyperinflammatory conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). \r\n      However, the underlying mechanisms of these conditions remain to be explored. \r\n      Here, we investigated the transcriptome of 1596 individuals, including patients \r\n      with COVID-19 in comparison to healthy controls, other acute inflammatory states \r\n      (HLH, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C], Kawasaki disease \r\n      [KD]), and different respiratory infections (seasonal coronavirus, influenza, \r\n      bacterial pneumonia). We observed that COVID-19 and HLH share immunological \r\n      pathways (cytokine/chemokine signaling and neutrophil-mediated immune responses), \r\n      including gene signatures that stratify COVID-19 patients admitted to the \r\n      intensive care unit (ICU) and COVID-19_nonICU patients. Of note, among the common \r\n      differentially expressed genes (DEG), there is a cluster of neutrophil-associated \r\n      genes that reflects a generalized hyperinflammatory state since it is also \r\n      dysregulated in patients with KD and bacterial pneumonia. These genes are \r\n      dysregulated at the protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an \r\n      interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins that point \r\n      to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care \r\n      unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated \r\n      across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature \r\n      neutrophils. Artificial intelligence modeling confirmed the strong association of \r\n      these genes with COVID-19 severity. Thus, our work indicates putative therapeutic \r\n      pathways for intervention.\r\nFAU - Schimke, Lena F\r\nAU  - Schimke LF\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5616-3410\r\nAD  - Department of Imunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.\r\nFAU -

In a study of forty-eight healthy adult volunteers who received \r\n      either the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo, we profiled intracellular \r\n      microRNAs (miRNAs) from whole blood cells (WB) and circulating miRNAs from \r\n      serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) at baseline and longitudinally \r\n      following vaccination. Further, we identified early miRNA signatures associated \r\n      with ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at baseline and up to one year \r\n      post-vaccination, and pinpointed target mRNA transcripts and pathways correlated \r\n      to miRNAs whose expression was altered after vaccination by using systems biology \r\n      approaches. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) and miRNA \r\n      signatures predicted high or low IgG ZEBOV-specific antibody levels with high \r\n      classification performance. The top miRNA discriminators were WB-miR-6810, \r\n      EV-miR-7151-3p, and EV-miR-4426. An eight-miRNA antibody predictive signature was \r\n      associated with immune-related target mRNAs and pathways. These findings provide \r\n      valuable insights into early blood biomarkers associated with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP \r\n      vaccine-induced IgG antibody responses.\r\nCI  - © 2023 The Author(s).\r\nFAU -

e1007880\r\nLID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007880 [doi]\r\nLID - e1007880\r\nAB  - The largest ever recorded epidemic of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) broke out in \r\n      2004 and affected four continents. Acute symptomatic infections are typically \r\n      associated with the onset of fever and often debilitating \r\n      polyarthralgia/polyarthritis. In this study, a systems biology approach was \r\n      adopted to analyze the blood transcriptomes of adults acutely infected with the \r\n      CHIKV. Gene signatures that were associated with viral RNA levels and the onset \r\n      of symptoms were identified. Among these genes, the putative role of the \r\n      Eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF) family genes and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing \r\n      catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC3A) in the CHIKV replication process were \r\n      displayed. We further compared these signatures with signatures induced by the \r\n      Dengue virus infection and rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, we demonstrated that \r\n      the CHIKV in vitro infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced \r\n      IL-1 beta production in a mechanism that is significantly dependent on the \r\n      inflammasome NLRP3 activation. The observations provided valuable insights into \r\n      virus-host interactions during the acute phase and can be instrumental in the \r\n      investigation of new and effective therapeutic interventions.\r\nFAU -

Since the knowledge of memory generation has been centered \r\n      on in vivo models of infection, there are obstacles to deep molecular analysis of \r\n      differentiating subsets. Here we defined a novel in vitro CD8 T cell activation \r\n      and culture regimen using low TCR engagement and cytokines to generate \r\n      differentiated cells consistent with central memory-like cells, as shown by \r\n      surface phenotype, gene expression profile and lack of cytotoxic function after \r\n      challenge. Our results showed an effector signature expressed by in vitro memory \r\n      precursors and their plasticity under specific conditions. Moreover, memory CD8 T \r\n      cells conferred long-term protection against bacterial infection and slowed in \r\n      vivo tumor growth more efficiently than effector cells. This model may allow \r\n      further understanding of CD8 T cell memory molecular differentiation subsets and \r\n      be suited for generating cells to be used for immunotherapy.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 Neitzke-Montinelli, Calôba, Melo, Frade, Caramez, Mazzoccoli, \r\n      Gonçalves, Nakaya, Pereira, Werneck and Viola.\r\nFAU - Neitzke-Montinelli, Vanessa\r\nAU  - Neitzke-Montinelli V\r\nAD  - Program of Immunology and Tumor Biology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute, \r\n      Instituto Nacional de Câncer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Calôba, Carolina\r\nAU  - Calôba C\r\nAD  - Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de \r\n      Janeiro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Melo, Guilherme\r\nAU  - Melo G\r\nAD  - Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro \r\n      (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Frade, Bianca B\r\nAU  - Frade BB\r\nAD  - Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de \r\n      Janeiro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Caramez, Enzo\r\nAU  - Caramez E\r\nAD  - Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de \r\n      Janeiro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Mazzoccoli, Luciano\r\nAU  - Mazzoccoli L\r\nAD  - Program of Immunology and Tumor Biology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute, \r\n      Instituto Nacional de Câncer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, André N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pereira, Renata M\r\nAU  - Pereira RM\r\nAD  - Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro \r\n      (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Werneck, Miriam B F\r\nAU  - Werneck MBF\r\nAD  - Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de \r\n      Janeiro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Viola, João P B\r\nAU  - Viola JPB\r\nAD  - Program of Immunology and Tumor Biology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute, \r\n      Instituto Nacional de Câncer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20220523\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes\r\nMH  - Cell Differentiation/genetics\r\nMH  - Gene Expression\r\nMH  - *Immunologic Memory\r\nMH  - T-Lymphocyte Subsets\r\nPMC - PMC9168330\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - CD8 T cell differentiation\r\nOT  - adoptive cell transfer\r\nOT  - cytotoxicity\r\nOT  - immunological memory\r\nOT  - immunotherapy\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2022/06/10 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2022/06/11 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2022/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2022/06/09 02:06\r\nPHST- 2021/12/20 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2022/04/19 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2022/06/09 02:06 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2022/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2022/06/11 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2022/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.840203 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Immunol. 2022 May 23;13:840203. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.840203. eCollection \r\n      2022.\r\n\r\nPMID- 35739193\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20220819\r\nLR  - 20250728\r\nIS  - 1935-3456 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1933-0219 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1933-0219 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 15\r\nIP  - 5\r\nDP  - 2022 May\r\nTI  - Molecular alterations in human milk in simulated maternal nasal mucosal infection \r\n      with live attenuated influenza vaccination.\r\nPG  - 1040-1047\r\nLID - 10.1038/s41385-022-00537-4 [doi]\r\nAB  - Breastfeeding protects against mucosal infections in infants. The underlying \r\n      mechanisms through which immunity develops in human milk following maternal \r\n      infection with mucosal pathogens are not well understood. We simulated nasal \r\n      mucosal influenza infection through live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV) \r\n      and compared immune responses in milk to inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV). \r\n      Transcriptomic analysis was performed on RNA extracted from human milk cells to \r\n      evaluate differentially expressed genes and pathways on days 1 and 7 \r\n      post-vaccination. Both LAIV and IIV vaccines induced influenza-specific IgA that \r\n      persisted for at least 6 months. Regulation of type I interferon production, \r\n      toll-like receptor, and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways were \r\n      highly upregulated in milk on day 1 following LAIV but not IIV at any time point. \r\n      Upregulation of innate immunity in human milk may provide timely protection \r\n      against mucosal infections until antigen-specific immunity develops in the human \r\n      milk-fed infant.\r\nCI  - © 2022.

Tools that track the number \r\n      and locations of cases are critical for surveillance and help in making policy \r\n      decisions for controlling the outbreak. However, the current surveillance \r\n      web-based dashboards run on proprietary platforms, which are often expensive and \r\n      require specific computational knowledge. We developed a user-friendly web tool, \r\n      named OUTBREAK, that facilitates epidemic surveillance by showing in an animated \r\n      graph the timeline and geolocations of cases of an outbreak. It permits even \r\n      non-specialist users to input data most conveniently and track outbreaks in \r\n      real-time. We applied our tool to visualize the SARS 2003, MERS, and COVID19 \r\n      epidemics, and provided them as examples on the website. Through the zoom \r\n      feature, it is also possible to visualize cases at city and even neighborhood \r\n      levels. We made the tool freely available at https://outbreak.sysbio.tools/ . \r\n      OUTBREAK has the potential to guide and help health authorities to intervene and \r\n      minimize the effects of outbreaks.\r\nFAU - Arias-Carrasco, Raúl\r\nAU  - Arias-Carrasco R\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases - ACCDiS, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santos Dumont, 964, Independencia, 8380494, \r\n      Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile.\r\nFAU - Giddaluru, Jeevan\r\nAU  - Giddaluru J\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, Av.

Here our aim was to correlate the mTOR \r\n      (mammalian/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) and autophagy pathways with the \r\n      disease severity. Through western blotting and RNA analysis, we found increased \r\n      mTOR signaling and suppression of genes related to autophagy, lysosome, and \r\n      vesicle fusion in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as in \r\n      transcriptomic data mining of bronchoalveolar epithelial cells from severe \r\n      COVID-19 patients. Immunofluorescence co-localization assays also indicated that \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 colocalizes within autophagosomes but not with a lysosomal marker. Our \r\n      findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can benefit from compromised autophagic flux \r\n      and inhibited exocytosis in individuals with chronic hyperactivation of mTOR \r\n      signaling.\r\nFAU -

However, the links between those processes remain partially \r\n      characterized. Moreover, whether and how therapeutically manipulating T cells may \r\n      benefit patients are unknown. Our genetic and pharmacological evidence \r\n      demonstrates that the ion channel TMEM176B inhibited inflammasome activation \r\n      triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related murine β-coronavirus. \r\n      Tmem176b(-/-) mice infected with murine β-coronavirus developed \r\n      inflammasome-dependent T cell dysfunction and critical disease, which was \r\n      controlled by modulating dysfunctional T cells with PD-1 blockers. In critical \r\n      COVID-19, inflammasome activation correlated with dysfunctional T cells and low \r\n      monocytic TMEM176B expression, whereas PD-L1 blockade rescued T cell \r\n      functionality. Here, we mechanistically link T cell dysfunction and inflammation, \r\n      supporting a cancer immunotherapy to reinforce T cell immunity in critical \r\n      β-coronavirus disease.\r\nFAU - Duhalde Vega, Maite\r\nAU  -

Since mammalian cells have multiple mechanisms to control gene \r\n      expression, different molecules, such as noncoding RNAs, can be involved in this \r\n      process. MicroRNAs have been extensively studied upon Leishmania infection, but \r\n      whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also altered in macrophages is still \r\n      unexplored. We performed RNA-seq from THP-1-derived macrophages infected with \r\n      Leishmania amazonensis (La), L. braziliensis (Lb), and L. infantum (Li), \r\n      investigating a previously unappreciated fraction of macrophage transcriptome. We \r\n      found that more than 24% of the total annotated transcripts and 30% of \r\n      differentially expressed (DE) RNAs in Leishmania-infected macrophage correspond \r\n      to lncRNAs. LncRNAs and protein coding RNAs with altered expression are similar \r\n      among macrophages infected with the Leishmania species. Still, some \r\n      species-specific alterations could occur due to distinct pathophysiology in which \r\n      Li infection led to a more significant number of exclusively DE RNAs. The most \r\n      represented classes among DE lncRNAs were intergenic and antisense lncRNAs. We \r\n      also found enrichment for immune response-related pathways in the DE protein \r\n      coding RNAs, as well as putative targets of the lncRNAs. We performed a \r\n      coexpression analysis to explore potential cis regulation of coding and antisense \r\n      noncoding transcripts. We identified that antisense lncRNAs are similarly \r\n      regulated as its neighbor protein coding genes, such as the BAALC/BAALC-AS1, \r\n      BAALC/BAALC-AS2, HIF1A/HIF1A-AS1, HIF1A/HIF1A-AS3 and IRF1/IRF1-AS1 pairs, which \r\n      can occur as a species-specific modulation. These findings are a novelty in the \r\n      field because, to date, no study has focused on analyzing lncRNAs in \r\n      Leishmania-infected macrophage. Our results suggest that lncRNAs may account for \r\n      a novel mechanism by which Leishmania can control macrophage function. Further \r\n      research must validate putative lncRNA targets and provide additional prospects \r\n      in lncRNA function during Leishmania infection.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2023 Fernandes, Gonçalves, Floeter-Winter, Nakaya and Muxel.\r\nFAU - Fernandes, Juliane C R\r\nAU  - Fernandes JCR\r\nAD  - Departamento de Fisiologia, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, André N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-USP (SPPU), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Floeter-Winter, Lucile M\r\nAU  - Floeter-Winter LM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Fisiologia, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Muxel, Sandra M\r\nAU  - Muxel SM\r\nAD  - Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20230104\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Genet\r\nJT  - Frontiers in genetics\r\nJID - 101560621\r\nPMC - PMC9845402\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Leishmania\r\nOT  - RNA-seq\r\nOT  - THP-1\r\nOT  - gene expression\r\nOT  - host-parasite interaction\r\nOT  - lncRNA\r\nOT  - macrophage\r\nOT  - transcriptomics\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2023/01/24 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2023/01/24 06:01\r\nPMCR- 2023/01/04\r\nCRDT- 2023/01/23 04:43\r\nPHST- 2022/09/23 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2022/11/25 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2023/01/23 04:43 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2023/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2023/01/24 06:01 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2023/01/04 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 1051568 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.1051568 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Genet. 2023 Jan 4;13:1051568. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.1051568. eCollection \r\n      2022.\r\n\r\nPMID- 26632272\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20160607\r\nLR  - 20160123\r\nIS  - 1090-2163 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0008-8749 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 300\r\nDP  - 2016 Feb\r\nTI  - Myeloperoxidase in human peripheral blood lymphocytes: Production and subcellular \r\n      localization.\r\nPG  - 18-25\r\nLID - S0008-8749(15)30037-X [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.cellimm.2015.11.003 [doi]\r\nAB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an important enzyme in the front-line protection against \r\n      microorganisms. In peripheral blood, it is accepted that MPO is only produced by \r\n      myeloid-lineage cells. Thus, MPO presence is unexpected in lymphocytes. We showed \r\n      recently that B1-lymphocytes from mice have MPO. Here, we showed that subsets of \r\n      human peripheral B, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes express MPO. The content of \r\n      MPO in lymphocytes was very low compared to neutrophils/monocytes with a \r\n      preferential distribution in the nucleus and perinuclear region. Also, we \r\n      performed a MPO mRNA expression analysis from human blood cells derived from \r\n      microarray raw data publicly available, showing that MPO is modulated in \r\n      infectious disease. MPO was increased in CD4(+) T lymphocytes from HIV chronic \r\n      infection and in CD8(+) T lymphocytes from HCV-positive patients. Our study \r\n      points out MPO as a multifunctional protein due to its subcellular localization \r\n      and expression modulation in lymphocytes indicating alternative unknown functions \r\n      for MPO in lymphocytes.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Several inhibitors of CCL2 and \r\n      its receptor CCR2 are in development and may find application for treatment of \r\n      certain inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune and viral arthritides. Here \r\n      we used CCR2(-/-) mice to determine the effect of CCR2 deficiency on CHIKV \r\n      infection and arthritis. Although there were no significant changes in viral load \r\n      or RNA persistence and only marginal changes in antiviral immunity, arthritic \r\n      disease was substantially increased and prolonged in CCR2(-/-) mice compared to \r\n      wild-type mice. The monocyte/macrophage infiltrate was replaced in CCR2(-/-) mice \r\n      by a severe neutrophil (followed by an eosinophil) infiltrate and was associated \r\n      with changes in the expression levels of multiple inflammatory mediators \r\n      (including CXCL1, CXCL2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], \r\n      interleukin-1β [IL-1β], and IL-10). The loss of anti-inflammatory macrophages and \r\n      their activities (e.g., efferocytosis) was also implicated in exacerbated \r\n      inflammation. Clear evidence of cartilage damage was also seen in CHIKV-infected \r\n      CCR2(-/-) mice, a feature not normally associated with alphaviral arthritides. \r\n      Although recruitment of CCR2(+) monocytes/macrophages can contribute to \r\n      inflammation, it also appears to be critical for preventing excessive pathology \r\n      and resolving inflammation following alphavirus infection. Caution might thus be \r\n      warranted when considering therapeutic targeting of CCR2/CCL2 for the treatment \r\n      of alphaviral arthritides. IMPORTANCE: Here we describe the first analysis of \r\n      viral arthritis in mice deficient for the chemokine receptor CCR2. CCR2 is \r\n      thought to be central to the monocyte/macrophage-dominated inflammatory arthritic \r\n      infiltrates seen after infection with arthritogenic alphaviruses such as \r\n      chikungunya virus. Surprisingly, the viral arthritis caused by chikungunya virus \r\n      in CCR2-deficient mice was more severe, prolonged, and erosive and was neutrophil \r\n      dominated, with viral replication and persistence not being significantly \r\n      affected. Monocytes/macrophages recruited by CCL2 thus also appear to be \r\n      important for both preventing even worse pathology mediated by neutrophils and \r\n      promoting resolution of inflammation. Caution might thus be warranted when \r\n      considering the use of therapeutic agents that target CCR2/CCL2 or inflammatory \r\n      monocytes/macrophages for the treatment of alphaviral (and perhaps other viral) \r\n      arthritides. Individuals with diminished CCR2 responses (due to drug treatment or \r\n      other reasons) may also be at risk of exacerbated arthritic disease following \r\n      alphaviral infection.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Using a mouse model of CHIKV infection and arthritic \r\n      disease, we show that CHIKV replication and the ensuing foot arthropathy were \r\n      dramatically reduced when mice were housed at 30°C, rather than the conventional \r\n      22°C. The effect was not associated with a detectable fever, but was dependent on \r\n      type I interferon responses. Bioinformatics analyses of RNA-Seq data after \r\n      injection of poly(I:C)/jetPEI suggested the unfolded protein response and certain \r\n      type I interferon responses are promoted when feet are slightly warmer. The \r\n      ambient temperature thus appears able profoundly to effect anti-viral activity in \r\n      the periphery, with clear consequences for alphaviral replication and the ensuing \r\n      arthropathy. These observations may provide an explanation for why alphaviral \r\n      arthropathies are largely restricted to joints of the limbs and the extremities.\r\nFAU - Prow, Natalie A\r\nAU  - Prow NA\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nAD  - Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Tang, Bing\r\nAU  - Tang B\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Gardner, Joy\r\nAU  - Gardner J\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Le, Thuy T\r\nAU  - Le TT\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Taylor, Adam\r\nAU  - Taylor A\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7159-3961\r\nAD  - Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Poo, Yee S\r\nAU  - Poo YS\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Nakayama, Eri\r\nAU  - Nakayama E\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nAD  - Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, \r\n      Japan.\r\nFAU - Hirata, Thiago D C\r\nAU  - Hirata TDC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3967-8121\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Slonchak, Andrii\r\nAU  - Slonchak A\r\nAD  - School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland, \r\n      Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Mukhopadhyay, Pamela\r\nAU  - Mukhopadhyay P\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Mahalingam, Suresh\r\nAU  - Mahalingam S\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3141-8410\r\nAD  - Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Schroder, Wayne A\r\nAU  - Schroder WA\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nFAU - Klimstra, William\r\nAU  - Klimstra W\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Center for Vaccine Research \r\n      University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Suhrbier, Andreas\r\nAU  - Suhrbier A\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8986-9025\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nAD  - Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R01 AI095436/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20171227\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PLoS Pathog\r\nJT  - PLoS pathogens\r\nJID - 101238921\r\nRN  - 0 (Interferon Type I)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Alphavirus Infections/*immunology/pathology/*virology\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Arthritis, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/*virology\r\nMH  - Arthritis, Infectious/*immunology/pathology/*virology\r\nMH  - Chikungunya Fever/immunology/pathology/virology\r\nMH  - Chikungunya virus/immunology/pathogenicity/physiology\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Foot\r\nMH  - Host-Pathogen Interactions/immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Interferon Type I/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Ross River virus/immunology/pathogenicity/physiology\r\nMH  - Temperature\r\nMH  - Viral Load\r\nMH  - Virus Replication/immunology/physiology\r\nPMC - PMC5770078\r\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\r\nEDAT- 2017/12/28 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2018/06/26 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2017/12/27\r\nCRDT- 2017/12/28 06:00\r\nPHST- 2017/08/02 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2017/12/04 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2018/01/16 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2017/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2017/12/28 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2017/12/27 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - PPATHOGENS-D-17-01681 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006788 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - PLoS Pathog. 2017 Dec 27;13(12):e1006788. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006788. \r\n      eCollection 2017 Dec.\r\n\r\nPMID- 33497364\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20220110\r\nLR  - 20250530\r\nIS  - 2379-3708 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2379-3708 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 6\r\nIP  - 4\r\nDP  - 2021 Feb 22\r\nTI  - Pneumococcal colonization impairs mucosal immune responses to live attenuated \r\n      influenza vaccine.\r\nLID - 141088 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1172/jci.insight.141088 [doi]\r\nLID - e141088\r\nAB  - Influenza virus infections affect millions of people annually, and current \r\n      available vaccines provide varying rates of protection. However, the way in which \r\n      the nasal microbiota, particularly established pneumococcal colonization, shape \r\n      the response to influenza vaccination is not yet fully understood. In this study, \r\n      we inoculated healthy adults with live Streptococcus pneumoniae and vaccinated \r\n      them 3 days later with either tetravalent-inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or \r\n      live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Vaccine-induced immune responses were \r\n      assessed in nose, blood, and lung. Nasal pneumococcal colonization had no impact \r\n      upon TIV-induced antibody responses to influenza, which manifested in all \r\n      compartments. However, experimentally induced pneumococcal colonization dampened \r\n      LAIV-mediated mucosal antibody responses, primarily IgA in the nose and IgG in \r\n      the lung. Pulmonary influenza-specific cellular responses were more apparent in \r\n      the LAIV group compared with either the TIV or an unvaccinated group. These \r\n      results indicate that TIV and LAIV elicit differential immunity to adults and \r\n      that LAIV immunogenicity is diminished by the nasal presence of S. pneumoniae. \r\n      Therefore, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may affect LAIV efficacy.\r\nFAU -

1033364\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1033364 [doi]\r\nLID - 1033364\r\nAB  - This is the third year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and yet most children remain \r\n      unvaccinated. COVID-19 in children manifests as mostly mild or asymptomatic, \r\n      however high viral titers and strong cellular and humoral responses are observed \r\n      upon acute infection. It is still unclear how long these responses persist, and \r\n      if they can protect from re-infection and/or disease severity. Here, we analyzed \r\n      immune memory responses in a cohort of children and adults with COVID-19. \r\n      Important differences between children and adults are evident in kinetics and \r\n      profile of memory responses. Children develop early N-specific cytotoxic T cell \r\n      responses, that rapidly expand and dominate their immune memory to the virus. \r\n      Children's anti-N, but not anti-S, antibody titers increase over time. \r\n      Neutralization titers correlate with N-specific antibodies and CD8(+)T cells. \r\n      However, antibodies generated by infection do not efficiently cross-neutralize \r\n      variants Gamma or Delta. Our results indicate that mechanisms that protect from \r\n      disease severity are possibly different from those that protect from reinfection, \r\n      bringing novel insights for pediatric vaccine design. They also underline the \r\n      importance of vaccination in children, who remain at risk for COVID-19 despite \r\n      having been previously infected.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 Lima, Fontoura, de Souza, Fazolo, Hilario, Zorzetto, Rodrigues \r\n      Junior, Coimbra, Borin, Bispo-dos-Santos, Granja, Marques, Zavaglia, Fernandes, \r\n      Varela, Polese-Bonatto, Tonini, Ikeda do Carmo, de Almeida, Borges, Nakaya, \r\n      Proenca-Modena, Callegari-Jacques, Scotta, Stein and Bonorino.\r\nFAU -

However, errors in the records and the \r\n      high computational costs involved make linking large administrative databases \r\n      using record linkage (RL) methodologies a major challenge. METHODS: We present \r\n      Tucuxi-BLAST, a versatile tool for probabilistic RL that utilizes a DNA-encoded \r\n      approach to encrypt, analyze and link massive administrative databases. \r\n      Tucuxi-BLAST encodes the identification records into DNA. BLASTn algorithm is \r\n      then used to align the sequences between databases. We tested and benchmarked on \r\n      a simulated database containing records for 300 million individuals and also on \r\n      four large administrative databases containing real data on Brazilian patients. \r\n      RESULTS: Our method was able to overcome misspellings and typographical errors in \r\n      administrative databases. In processing the RL of the largest simulated dataset \r\n      (200k records), the state-of-the-art method took 5 days and 7 h to perform the \r\n      RL, while Tucuxi-BLAST only took 23 h. When compared with five existing RL tools \r\n      applied to a gold-standard dataset from real health-related databases, \r\n      Tucuxi-BLAST had the highest accuracy and speed. By repurposing genomic tools, \r\n      Tucuxi-BLAST can improve data-driven medical research and provide a fast and \r\n      accurate way to link individual information across several administrative \r\n      databases.\r\nCI  - © 2022 Araujo et al.\r\nFAU - Araujo, José Deney\r\nAU  - Araujo JD\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Santos-E-Silva, Juan Carlo\r\nAU  - Santos-E-Silva JC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7327-4294\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Costa-Martins, André Guilherme\r\nAU  - Costa-Martins AG\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sampaio, Vanderson\r\nAU  - Sampaio V\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto Todos pela Saúde, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Castro, Daniel Barros\r\nAU  - de Castro DB\r\nAD  - Fundação de Vigilância em Saúde do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Souza, Robson F\r\nAU  - de Souza RF\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5284-4630\r\nAD  - Departamento de Microbiologia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Giddaluru, Jeevan\r\nAU  - Giddaluru J\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Ramos, Pablo Ivan P\r\nAU  - Ramos PIP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9075-7861\r\nAD  - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pita, Robespierre\r\nAU  - Pita R\r\nAD  - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Barreto, Mauricio L\r\nAU  - Barreto ML\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0215-4930\r\nAD  - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Barral-Netto, Manoel\r\nAU  - Barral-Netto M\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5823-7903\r\nAD  - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto Todos pela Saúde, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20220711\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PeerJ\r\nJT  - PeerJ\r\nJID - 101603425\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Medical Record Linkage/methods\r\nMH  - Databases, Factual\r\nMH  - Brazil\r\nMH  - *Biomedical Research\r\nMH  - Public Health\r\nPMC - PMC9281601\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - BLAST\r\nOT  - DNA-encoded\r\nOT  - Epidemiology\r\nOT  - Genomic tools\r\nOT  - Record linkage\r\nCOIS- Helder I.

This \r\n      study aimed to identify molecular markers related to joint pain and chronicity in \r\n      CHIKV-infected individuals by analyzing blood transcriptomes using bulk RNA \r\n      sequencing. B- and T-cell receptor (BCR and TCR) diversity was assessed through \r\n      computational analysis of RNA-seq data, revealing a significant reduction in CDR3 \r\n      diversity in CHIKV-infected individuals compared to healthy controls. This \r\n      reduced diversity was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in \r\n      osteoclast differentiation and activation, particularly through the RANK/RANKL \r\n      signaling pathway. These findings suggest a potential link between immune \r\n      dysregulation and enhanced osteoclast activity, which may contribute to the \r\n      persistence of joint pain in chronic CHIKF. Targeting osteoclast-related pathways \r\n      could offer therapeutic strategies for managing chronic symptoms in CHIKF \r\n      patients.\r\nFAU - Urbanski, Alysson Henrique\r\nAU  - Urbanski AH\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Maso, Vanessa E\r\nAU  - Maso VE\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-4108-0206\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martins, Felipe M\r\nAU  - Martins FM\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Costa-Martins, André Guilherme\r\nAU  - da Costa-Martins AG\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2719-8224\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Micromanufacturing Laboratory, Institute for Technological Research-IPT, São \r\n      Paulo 05508-901, Brazil.\r\nFAU - do Nascimento Oliveira, Ana Paula B\r\nAU  - do Nascimento Oliveira APB\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4700-1671\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo 05653-000, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 001/Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior/\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20240920\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Infect Dis Rep\r\nJT  - Infectious disease reports\r\nJID - 101537203\r\nPMC - PMC11417755\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - B cells\r\nOT  - CDR3\r\nOT  - RANK signaling\r\nOT  - T cells\r\nOT  - chikungunya fever\r\nOT  - rheumatoid arthritis\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2024/09/23 12:47\r\nMHDA- 2024/09/23 12:48\r\nPMCR- 2024/09/20\r\nCRDT- 2024/09/23 07:24\r\nPHST- 2024/07/24 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/10 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/11 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/23 12:48 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/23 12:47 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/23 07:24 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2024/09/20 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - idr16050073 [pii]\r\nAID - idr-16-00073 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.3390/idr16050073 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Infect Dis Rep. 2024 Sep 20;16(5):914-922. doi: 10.3390/idr16050073.\r\n\r\nPMID- 41285137\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- Publisher\r\nLR  - 20251124\r\nIS  - 2666-5247 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2666-5247 (Linking)\r\nDP  - 2025 Nov 21\r\nTI  - Tackling vaccine hyporesponsiveness through global collaboration, diverse \r\n      population studies, and data integration.\r\nPG  - 101263\r\nLID - S2666-5247(25)00191-0 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.lanmic.2025.101263 [doi]\r\nAB  - Vaccines have improved global health substantially, preventing millions of deaths \r\n      worldwide. However, striking variations in the immunogenicity and efficacy of \r\n      some vaccines persist across populations. Notably, suboptimal responses to some \r\n      vaccines, also known as vaccine hyporesponsiveness, have been observed in \r\n      low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income \r\n      countries or in rural areas within LMICs compared with urban areas within LMICs. \r\n      Environmental factors, host genetics, lifestyle, and nutrition contribute to \r\n      immunological variations influencing vaccine responses, highlighting the need to \r\n      identify key immune signatures that can be manipulated to overcome vaccine \r\n      hyporesponsiveness. The integration of diverse datasets, accelerated by \r\n      artificial intelligence, is essential to achieve this goal, which is currently \r\n      hampered by the under-representation of data from LMICs. The HypoVax Global \r\n      knowledge hub aims to address this gap by fostering international collaboration \r\n      and compiling globally representative immunological data from population studies \r\n      and vaccine trials. The hub offers a platform for high-dimensional data analyses, \r\n      promotes equitable partnerships, and strives to ensure that all contributions \r\n      lead to context-specific insights that can inform immunisation strategies to \r\n      ultimately overcome vaccine hyporesponsiveness.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The \r\n      immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcus during colonization are well \r\n      studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of \r\n      pneumococcus following infection with influenza virus is associated with \r\n      secondary bacterial pneumonia. We used a human challenge model with type 6B \r\n      pneumococcus to show that acquisition of pneumococcus induced early degranulation \r\n      of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose. Monocyte \r\n      function was associated with the clearance of pneumococcus. Prior nasal infection \r\n      with live attenuated influenza virus induced inflammation, impaired innate immune \r\n      function and altered genome-wide nasal gene responses to the carriage of \r\n      pneumococcus. Levels of the cytokine CXCL10, promoted by viral infection, at the \r\n      time pneumococcus was encountered were positively associated with bacterial load.\r\nFAU - Jochems, Simon P\r\nAU  - Jochems SP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4835-1032\r\nAD  -

Here we assess the difference \r\n      in cellular or humoral immune responses of pediatric and adult COVID-19 patients \r\n      to see if these factors contribute to the severity dichotomy. Children's \r\n      non-specific immune profile is dominated by naive lymphocytes and \r\n      HLA-DR(high)CX3CR1(low) dendritic cells; meanwhile, children show strong specific \r\n      antibody and T cell responses for viral structural proteins, with their T cell \r\n      responses differing from adults by having weaker CD8(+)TNF(+) T cells responses \r\n      to S peptide pool but stronger responses to N and M peptide pools. Finally, viral \r\n      mRNA is more abundant in pediatric patients. Our data thus support a scenario in \r\n      which SARS-CoV-2 infected children contribute to transmission yet are less \r\n      susceptible to COVID-19 symptoms due to strong and differential responses to the \r\n      virus.\r\nCI  - © 2021.

Morphological, cellular, and molecular basis of brain infection in COVID-19 \r\n      patients.\r\nPG  - e2200960119\r\nLID - 10.1073/pnas.2200960119 [doi]\r\nLID - e2200960119\r\nAB  - Although increasing evidence confirms neuropsychiatric manifestations associated \r\n      mainly with severe COVID-19 infection, long-term neuropsychiatric dysfunction \r\n      (recently characterized as part of \"long COVID-19\" syndrome) has been frequently \r\n      observed after mild infection. We show the spectrum of cerebral impact of severe \r\n      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, ranging from \r\n      long-term alterations in mildly infected individuals (orbitofrontal cortical \r\n      atrophy, neurocognitive impairment, excessive fatigue and anxiety symptoms) to \r\n      severe acute damage confirmed in brain tissue samples extracted from the \r\n      orbitofrontal region (via endonasal transethmoidal access) from individuals who \r\n      died of COVID-19. In an independent cohort of 26 individuals who died of \r\n      COVID-19, we used histopathological signs of brain damage as a guide for possible \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and found that among the 5 individuals who exhibited \r\n      those signs, all of them had genetic material of the virus in the brain. Brain \r\n      tissue samples from these five patients also exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 \r\n      infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. Supporting the hypothesis \r\n      of astrocyte infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes in vitro are \r\n      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a noncanonical mechanism that \r\n      involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested \r\n      changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel \r\n      neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, human \r\n      astrocyte infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal \r\n      viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, \r\n      infects astrocytes, and consequently, leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. \r\n      These deregulated processes could contribute to the structural and functional \r\n      alterations seen in the brains of COVID-19 patients.\r\nFAU -

However, \r\n      the mechanisms driving Chagas disease cardiomyopathy have not been completely \r\n      elucidated. Here, we show that the canonical PI3Kγ pathway is upregulated in both \r\n      human chagasic hearts and hearts of acutely infected mice. PI3Kγ-deficient mice \r\n      and mutant mice carrying catalytically inactive PI3Kγ are more susceptible to T. \r\n      cruzi infection. The canonical PI3Kγ signaling in myeloid cells is essential to \r\n      restrict T. cruzi heart parasitism and ultimately to avoid myocarditis, heart \r\n      damage, and death of mice. Furthermore, high PIK3CG expression correlates with \r\n      low parasitism in human Chagas' hearts. In conclusion, these results indicate an \r\n      essential role of the canonical PI3Kγ signaling pathway in the control of T. \r\n      cruzi infection, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved \r\n      in the pathophysiology of chagasic heart disease.\r\nFAU -

OBJECTIVES: The study protocol FHBGEP was design to \r\n      investigate the main genomic, epigenomic, and pharmacogenomic factors associated \r\n      with FH and polygenic hypercholesterolemia (PH). METHODS: FH patients will be \r\n      enrolled at six research centers in Brazil. An exon-targeted gene strategy will \r\n      be used to sequence a panel of 84 genes related to FH, PH, pharmacogenomics and \r\n      coronary artery disease. Variants in coding and regulatory regions will be \r\n      identified using a proposed variant discovery pipeline and classified according \r\n      to the American College Medical Genetics guidelines. Functional effects of \r\n      variants in FH-related genes will be investigated by in vitro studies using \r\n      lymphocytes and cell lines (HepG2, HUVEC and HEK293FT), CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, \r\n      luciferase reporter assay and other technologies. Functional studies in silico, \r\n      such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and conformational analysis, will \r\n      be used to explore the impact of novel variants on protein structure and \r\n      function. DNA methylation profile and differential expression of circulating \r\n      non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and lncRNAs) will be analyzed in FH patients and \r\n      normolipidemic subjects (control group). The influence of genomic and epigenomic \r\n      factors on metabolic and inflammatory status will be analyzed in FH patients. \r\n      Pharmacogenomic studies will be conducted to investigate the influence of genomic \r\n      and epigenomic factors on response to statins in FH patients. SUMMARY: The FHBGEP \r\n      protocol has the potential to elucidate the genetic basis and molecular \r\n      mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of FH and PH, particularly in the \r\n      Brazilian population. This pioneering approach includes genomic, epigenomic and \r\n      functional studies, which results will contribute to the improvement of the \r\n      diagnosis, prognosis and personalized therapy of FH patients.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, \r\n      the late effects of acute inflammation on energy homeostasis, regulation of body \r\n      weight and glucose metabolism are yet to be elucidated. Here, we addressed \r\n      whether serial intense endotoxemia, characterized by an acute phase response and \r\n      weight loss, could be an aggravating or predisposing factor to weight gain and \r\n      associated metabolic complications. Male Swiss Webster mice were submitted to 8 \r\n      consecutive doses of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg LPS), followed by 10 weeks on a \r\n      high-fat diet (HFD). LPS-treated mice did not show changes in weight when fed \r\n      standard chow. However, when challenged by a high-fat diet, LPS-treated mice \r\n      showed greater weight gain, with larger fat depot areas, increased serum leptin \r\n      and insulin levels and impaired insulin sensitivity when compared to mice on HFD \r\n      only. Acute endotoxemia caused a long-lasting increase in mRNA expression of \r\n      inflammatory markers such as TLR-4, CD14 and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the adipose \r\n      tissue, which may represent the key factors connecting inflammation to increased \r\n      susceptibility to weight gain and impaired glucose homeostasis. In an independent \r\n      experimental model, and using publicly available microarray data from adipose \r\n      tissue from mice infected with Gram-negative bacteria, we performed gene set \r\n      enrichment analysis and confirmed upregulation of a set of genes responsible for \r\n      cell proliferation and inflammation, including TLR-4 and SAA. Together, we showed \r\n      that conditions leading to intense and recurring endotoxemia, such as common \r\n      childhood bacterial infections, may resound for a long time and aggravate the \r\n      effects of a western diet. If confirmed in humans, infections should be \r\n      considered an additional factor contributing to obesity and type 2 diabetes \r\n      epidemics.\r\nFAU - Mendes de Oliveira, Edson\r\nAU  - Mendes de Oliveira E\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7330-7826\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, Av.

In \r\n      this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 \r\n      RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of \r\n      the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. We also demonstrated that \r\n      this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples \r\n      infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without \r\n      any viral infection. Although the majority of manuscripts recently published \r\n      using this technique describe only the presence of two-color states \r\n      (pink = negative and yellow = positive), we verified by naked-eye and absorbance \r\n      measurements that there is an evident third color cluster (orange), in general \r\n      related to positive samples with low viral loads, but which cannot be defined as \r\n      positive or negative by the naked eye. Orange colors should be repeated or tested \r\n      by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic. RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for \r\n      samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test. \r\n      All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 °C. The use of reaction time longer \r\n      than 30 min is also not recommended since nonspecific amplifications may cause \r\n      false positives.\r\nFAU - Aoki, Mateus Nóbrega\r\nAU  - Aoki MN\r\nAD  - Laboratory for Applied Science and Technology in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, \r\n      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Curitiba, 81310-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna\r\nAU  - de Oliveira Coelho B\r\nAD  - Laboratory for Applied Science and Technology in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, \r\n      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Curitiba, 81310-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Góes, Luiz Gustavo Bentim\r\nAU  - Góes LGB\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Departamento de Microbiologia - ICB-II, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, \r\n      05508-000, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Minoprio, Paola\r\nAU  - Minoprio P\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Durigon, Edison Luiz\r\nAU  - Durigon EL\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Departamento de Microbiologia - ICB-II, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, \r\n      05508-000, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Morello, Luis Gustavo\r\nAU  - Morello LG\r\nAD  - Laboratory for Applied Science and Technology in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, \r\n      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Curitiba, 81310-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Marchini, Fabricio Klerynton\r\nAU  - Marchini FK\r\nAD  - Laboratory for Applied Science and Technology in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, \r\n      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Curitiba, 81310-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Riediger, Irina Natassja\r\nAU  - Riediger IN\r\nAD  - Paraná´s Central Laboratory (LACEN-PR), Curitiba, 80045-150, Brazil.\r\nFAU - do Carmo Debur, Maria\r\nAU  - do Carmo Debur M\r\nAD  - Paraná´s Central Laboratory (LACEN-PR), Curitiba, 80045-150, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur - University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-020, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Blanes, Lucas\r\nAU  - Blanes L\r\nAD  - Laboratory for Applied Science and Technology in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, \r\n      Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Curitiba, 81310-020, Brazil. \r\n      lucas.blanes@fiocruz.br.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20210427\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Sci Rep\r\nJT  - Scientific reports\r\nJID - 101563288\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Viral)\r\nRN  - LAMP assay\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - COVID-19/*diagnosis/virology\r\nMH  - COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing\r\nMH  - Colorimetry\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods\r\nMH  - Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods\r\nMH  - RNA, Viral/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nMH  - SARS-CoV-2/*genetics/isolation & purification\r\nMH  - Viral Load\r\nPMC - PMC8079700\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no competing interests.\r\nEDAT- 2021/04/29 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/05/12 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2021/04/27\r\nCRDT- 2021/04/28 06:01\r\nPHST- 2020/12/06 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/28 06:01 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/27 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41598-021-88506-y [pii]\r\nAID - 88506 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41598-021-88506-y [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 27;11(1):9026. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88506-y.\r\n\r\nPMID- 37217153\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20230614\r\nLR  - 20230614\r\nIS  - 1879-0038 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0378-1119 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 875\r\nDP  - 2023 Jul 30\r\nTI  - Identification of pathogenic variants in the Brazilian cohort with Familial \r\n      hypercholesterolemia using exon-targeted gene sequencing.\r\nPG  - 147501\r\nLID - S0378-1119(23)00342-6 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.gene.2023.147501 [doi]\r\nAB  - Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic disease characterized by high \r\n      plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels and increased risk of \r\n      premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mutations in FH-related genes \r\n      account for 40% of FH cases worldwide. In this study, we aimed to assess the \r\n      pathogenic variants in FH-related genes in the Brazilian FH cohort FHBGEP using \r\n      exon-targeted gene sequencing (ETGS) strategy. FH patients (n = 210) were \r\n      enrolled at five clinical sites and peripheral blood samples were obtained for \r\n      laboratory testing and genomic DNA extraction. ETGS was performed using MiSeq \r\n      platform (Illumina). To identify deleterious variants in LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and \r\n      LDLRAP1, the long-reads were subjected to Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) for \r\n      alignment and mapping, followed by variant calling using Genome Analysis Toolkit \r\n      (GATK) and ANNOVAR for variant annotation. The variants were further filtered \r\n      using in-house custom scripts and classified according to the American College \r\n      Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. A total of 174 variants were \r\n      identified including 85 missense, 3 stop-gain, 9 splice-site, 6 InDel, and 71 in \r\n      regulatory regions (3'UTR and 5'UTR). Fifty-two patients (24.7%) had 30 known \r\n      pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in FH-related genes according to the \r\n      American College Medical and Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Fifty-three known \r\n      variants were classified as benign, or likely benign and 87 known variants have \r\n      shown uncertain significance. Four novel variants were discovered and classified \r\n      as such due to their absence in existing databases. In conclusion, ETGS and in \r\n      silico prediction studies are useful tools for screening deleterious variants and \r\n      identification of novel variants in FH-related genes, they also contribute to the \r\n      molecular diagnosis in the FHBGEP cohort.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the increasing evidence \r\n      of IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium, responsible \r\n      for malaria infection, no protein with potential function as an IP(3)-receptor \r\n      has been identified. The use of bioinformatic analyses based on previously known \r\n      sequences of IP(3)-receptor failed to identify potential IP(3)-receptor \r\n      candidates in any Apicomplexa. In this work, we combine the biochemical approach \r\n      of an IP(3) affinity chromatography column with bioinformatic meta-analyses to \r\n      identify potential vital membrane proteins that present binding with IP(3) \r\n      in Plasmodium falciparum.

Several genes were further analyzed in colonic \r\n      biopsies from Ulcerative Colitis patients and healthy controls. Lastly, we \r\n      generated Caco-2 cells lacking HMGCS2 by CRISPR Cas-9 and analyzed the functional \r\n      implications of its absence in Intestinal Epithelial Cells. RESULTS: Exposure to \r\n      a TLR ligand after thapsigargin treatment resulted in a powerful synergistic \r\n      modulation of gene expression, which led us to identify new genes and pathways \r\n      that could be involved in inflammatory responses linked to the Unfolded Protein \r\n      Response. Key differentially expressed genes in the array also exhibited \r\n      transcriptional alterations in colonic biopsies from active Ulcerative Colitis \r\n      patients, including NKG2D ligands and the enzyme HMGCS2. Moreover, functional \r\n      studies showed altered metabolic responses and epithelial barrier integrity in \r\n      HMGCS2 deficient cell lines. CONCLUSION: We have identified new genes and \r\n      pathways that are regulated by the Unfolded Protein Response in the context of \r\n      Inflammatory Bowel Disease including HMGCS2, a gene involved in the metabolism of \r\n      Short Chain Fatty Acids that may have an important role in intestinal \r\n      inflammation linked to Endoplasmic Reticulum stress and the resolution of the \r\n      epithelial damage.\r\nCI  -

Here, we analyze NPCs from three pairs \r\n      of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived \r\n      from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection \r\n      the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature \r\n      of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. \r\n      Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have \r\n      significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome \r\n      analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 \r\n      controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased \r\n      susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not \r\n      a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related \r\n      to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\r\nFAU -

Multiple \r\n      barriers to effective clinical translation exist. We hypothesize that an \r\n      ineffective use of the existing wealth of data from both product development and \r\n      clinical trials is a crucial barrier that hampers effective clinical \r\n      implementation of stem cell therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we summarize \r\n      the contribution of systems biology (SysBio) and artificial intelligence (AI) in \r\n      stem cell research and therapy development, to better understand and overcome \r\n      these barriers to effective clinical translation. Advancements in cell product \r\n      profiling technology, clinical trial design, and adjunct clinical monitoring, \r\n      offer new opportunities for a more integrated understanding of both, product and \r\n      patient performance. Synergy of SysBioAI analysis is boosting a more rapid, \r\n      integrated, and informative analysis of large‑scale multi‑omics data sets of \r\n      patient and clinical trial outcomes, thus enabling the \"Iterative Circle of \r\n      Refined Clinical Translation\". This SysBioAI‑supported concept can assist more \r\n      effective development and clinical use of stem cell therapeutics through \r\n      iterative adaptation cycles. This includes product‑ and patient‑centered clinical \r\n      safety and efficacy/potency evaluation through paired identification of suitable \r\n      biomarkers of clinical response. CONCLUSION: Integrated SysBioAI-use is a \r\n      powerful tool to optimize the design and outcomes of clinical trials by \r\n      identifying patient-specific responses, contributing to enhanced treatment safety \r\n      and efficacy, and to spur new patient-centric and adaptable next-generation \r\n      deep-medicine approaches.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2025.

Our previous studies \r\n      using mice deficient in the ATP-gated ionotropic P2X7 receptor suggested this \r\n      molecule as a promising target for host-directed therapy in severe pulmonary \r\n      tuberculosis. In this study, we assessed the effects of P2X7 pharmacological \r\n      blockade on disease severity. First, we observed an increase in P2RX7 gene \r\n      expression in the peripheral blood of tuberculosis patients compared to healthy \r\n      donors. Lung leukocytes of mice infected with hypervirulent mycobacteria also \r\n      showed increased expression of the P2X7 receptor. P2X7 blockade in mice with \r\n      advanced tuberculosis recapitulated in many aspects the disease in P2X7-deficient \r\n      mice. P2X7-directed therapy reduced body weight loss and the development of \r\n      inflammatory and necrotic lung lesions, as well as delayed mycobacterial growth. \r\n      Lower TNF-α production by lung cells and a substantial reduction in the lung \r\n      GR-1(+) myeloid cell population were observed after P2X7 inhibition. The effector \r\n      CD4(+) T cell population also decreased, but IFN-γ production by lung cells \r\n      increased. The presence of a large population with characteristics of myeloid \r\n      dendritic cells, as well as the increase in IL-6 production by lung cells, also \r\n      indicate a qualitative improvement in the pulmonary immune response due to P2X7 \r\n      inhibition. These findings support the use of drugs that target the P2X7 receptor \r\n      as a therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 Santiago-Carvalho, Almeida-Santos, Bomfim, Souza, Silva, Melo, \r\n      Amaral, Cione, Lasunskaia, Hirata, Alves-Filho, Nakaya, Alvarez and D’Império \r\n      Lima.\r\nFAU - Santiago-Carvalho, Igor\r\nAU  - Santiago-Carvalho I\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Almeida-Santos, Gislane\r\nAU  - de Almeida-Santos G\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bomfim, Caio César Barbosa\r\nAU  - Bomfim CCB\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Souza, Paula Carolina\r\nAU  - de Souza PC\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, Juan Carlo Santos E\r\nAU  - Silva JCSE\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas (FCF), USP, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Melo, Bruno Marcel Silva\r\nAU  - de Melo BMS\r\nAD  - Departamento de Farmacologia, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto, USP, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Amaral, Eduardo Pinheiro\r\nAU  - Amaral EP\r\nAD  - Immunobiology Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of \r\n      Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, \r\n      United States.\r\nFAU - Cione, Marcos Vinícios Pinheiro\r\nAU  - Cione MVP\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lasunskaia, Elena\r\nAU  - Lasunskaia E\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Biologia do Reconhecer, Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense \r\n      Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Hirata, Mario Hiroyuki\r\nAU  - Hirata MH\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas (FCF), USP, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Alves-Filho, José Carlos Farias\r\nAU  - Alves-Filho JCF\r\nAD  - Departamento de Farmacologia, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto, USP, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder Imoto\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Faculdade de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas (FCF), USP, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Alvarez, José Maria\r\nAU  - Alvarez JM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - D'Império Lima, Maria Regina\r\nAU  - D'Império Lima MR\r\nAD  - Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (ICB), Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20210505\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Cell Infect Microbiol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology\r\nJID - 101585359\r\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Lung\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Necrosis\r\nMH  - *Pneumonia\r\nMH  - Receptors, Purinergic P2X7\r\nMH  - *Tuberculosis\r\nMH  - *Tuberculosis, Pulmonary\r\nPMC - PMC8131868\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - P2X7 receptor\r\nOT  - lung damage\r\nOT  - tuberculosis\r\nOT  - adjuvant treatment\r\nOT  - host-direct therapies\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any \r\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential \r\n      conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2021/05/25 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/07/06 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2021/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2021/05/24 08:13\r\nPHST- 2021/02/25 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2021/05/24 08:13 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2021/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2021/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fcimb.2021.672472 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021 May 5;11:672472. doi: \r\n      10.3389/fcimb.2021.672472. eCollection 2021.\r\n\r\nPMID- 29454313\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20181102\r\nLR  - 20181113\r\nIS  - 1471-2105 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1471-2105 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 19\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2018 Feb 17\r\nTI  - StructRNAfinder: an automated pipeline and web server for RNA families \r\n      prediction.\r\nPG  - 55\r\nLID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2052-2 [doi]\r\nLID - 55\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The function of many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) depend upon their \r\n      secondary structures. Over the last decades, several methodologies have been \r\n      developed to predict such structures or to use them to functionally annotate RNAs \r\n      into RNA families. However, to fully perform this analysis, researchers should \r\n      utilize multiple tools, which require the constant parsing and processing of \r\n      several intermediate files. This makes the large-scale prediction and annotation \r\n      of RNAs a daunting task even to researchers with good computational or \r\n      bioinformatics skills. RESULTS: We present an automated pipeline named \r\n      StructRNAfinder that predicts and annotates RNA families in transcript or genome \r\n      sequences. This single tool not only displays the sequence/structural consensus \r\n      alignments for each RNA family, according to Rfam database but also provides a \r\n      taxonomic overview for each assigned functional RNA. Moreover, we implemented a \r\n      user-friendly web service that allows researchers to upload their own nucleotide \r\n      sequences in order to perform the whole analysis. Finally, we provided a \r\n      stand-alone version of StructRNAfinder to be used in large-scale projects. The \r\n      tool was developed under GNU General Public License (GPLv3) and is freely \r\n      available at http://structrnafinder.integrativebioinformatics.me . CONCLUSIONS: \r\n      The main advantage of StructRNAfinder relies on the large-scale processing and \r\n      integrating the data obtained by each tool and database employed along the \r\n      workflow, of which several files are generated and displayed in user-friendly \r\n      reports, useful for downstream analyses and data exploration.\r\nFAU - Arias-Carrasco, Raúl\r\nAU  - Arias-Carrasco R\r\nAD  - Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Mayor, \r\n      8580745, Santiago, Chile.\r\nAD  - Programa de Doctorado en Genómica Integrativa, Vicerrectoría de Investigación, \r\n      Universidad Mayor, 8580745, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Vásquez-Morán, Yessenia\r\nAU  - Vásquez-Morán Y\r\nAD  - Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Mayor, \r\n      8580745, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, \r\n      05508-900, Brazil. hnakaya@usp.br.\r\nFAU - Maracaja-Coutinho, Vinicius\r\nAU  - Maracaja-Coutinho V\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8873-9381\r\nAD  - Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Mayor, \r\n      8580745, Santiago, Chile. viniciusmaracaja@integrativebioinformatics.me.\r\nAD  - Instituto Vandique, João Pessoa, 58000-000, Brazil. \r\n      viniciusmaracaja@integrativebioinformatics.me.\r\nAD  - Beagle Bioinformatics, 8320000, Santiago, Chile. \r\n      viniciusmaracaja@integrativebioinformatics.me.\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, 8380492, Santiago, Chile. \r\n      viniciusmaracaja@integrativebioinformatics.me.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 11161020/Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y \r\n      Tecnológica/International\r\nGR  - PAI79170021/Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y \r\n      Tecnológica/International\r\nGR  - 15130011/Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y \r\n      Tecnológica/International\r\nGR  - 16BPE-62321/Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (CL)/International\r\nGR  - 14-SSAF-27061-9/Corporación de Fomento de la Producción/International\r\nGR  - 12/19278-6/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/International\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20180217\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - BMC Bioinformatics\r\nJT  - BMC bioinformatics\r\nJID - 100965194\r\nRN  - 63231-63-0 (RNA)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Automation\r\nMH  - Computational Biology/*methods\r\nMH  - *Internet\r\nMH  - RNA/chemistry/classification/*genetics\r\nMH  - *Software\r\nMH  - Workflow\r\nPMC - PMC5816368\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Covariance models\r\nOT  - Noncoding RNAs\r\nOT  - Pipeline\r\nOT  - RNA family\r\nOT  - RNA structure\r\nOT  - Tool\r\nOT  - Web server\r\nCOIS- ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent \r\n      inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). \r\n      TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In \r\n      subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and \r\n      could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent \r\n      trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely \r\n      correlated with later antibody titers.

A standardized research protocol \r\n      (the Common Protocol) guides the enrollment of participants with active pulmonary \r\n      tuberculosis and contacts into observational cohorts. The establishment of \r\n      harmonized clinical data and bio-repositories will allow cutting-edge, \r\n      large-scale advances in the understanding of tuberculosis, including \r\n      identification of novel biomarkers for progression to active tuberculosis and \r\n      relapse after treatment. The RePORT International infrastructure aims to support \r\n      research capacity development through enabling globally-diverse collaborations. \r\n      To that end, representatives from the RePORT International network sites, funding \r\n      agencies, and other stakeholders gathered together in Brazil in September 2017 to \r\n      present updates on relevant research findings and discuss ideas for \r\n      collaboration. Presenters emphasized research involving biomarker identification \r\n      for incipient tuberculosis, host immunity and pharmacogenomics, co-morbidities \r\n      such as HIV and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and tuberculosis transmission in \r\n      vulnerable and high-risk populations. Currently, 962 active TB participants and \r\n      670 household contacts have contributed blood, sputum, urine and microbes to \r\n      in-country biorepositories. Cross-consortium collaborations have begun sharing \r\n      data and specimens to analyze molecular and cytokine predictive patterns.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2018.

A \r\n      nationwide retrospective study.\r\nPG  - 100167\r\nLID - 10.1016/j.lana.2021.100167 [doi]\r\nLID - 100167\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The dominant effect of age on COVID-19 mortality obscures the impact \r\n      of other risk factors. Although the elderly is at a greater risk of severe \r\n      disease and death due to COVID-19, the interaction of obesity and age was not \r\n      carefully assessed. This analysis is especially critical for prioritizing groups \r\n      to receive COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Starting with 1,120,767 unvaccinated \r\n      individuals registered in a Brazilian surveillance system, we selected 313,898 \r\n      hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 20 to 89 who had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) and \r\n      cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or diabetes, as well as individuals with no risk \r\n      factors associated with severe COVID-19. Patient data were stratified by age, \r\n      obesity, BMI, and comorbidities, and subsequently, subjected to crude and \r\n      adjusted odds ratio, hazard ratio, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Disease outcomes were \r\n      invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) \r\n      admission, and death. FINDINGS: Obesity alone is a risk factor for in-hospital \r\n      mortality and is more significant than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. \r\n      Furthermore, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes increase the risk of \r\n      severity and death by COVID-19 more significantly in young adults than in the \r\n      elderly. When categorizing patients by obesity classes, the severity of obesity \r\n      was found to be associated with a higher risk of admission to the ICU and death \r\n      from COVID-19 than the non-obese young adults or elderly population. \r\n      INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the increased risk of severe COVID-19 on \r\n      the Brazilian obese youth. As SARS-CoV-2 may become a recurrent seasonal \r\n      infection, future vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 should prioritize obese \r\n      young individuals.

Here, we show \r\n      that deletion of Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 \r\n      (CaMKK2) promotes HSPC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery following \r\n      radiation injury. Using Camkk2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter \r\n      mice, we found that Camkk2 expression is developmentally regulated in HSPC. \r\n      Deletion of Camkk2 in HSPC results in a significant downregulation of genes \r\n      affiliated with the quiescent signature. Accordingly, HSPC from Camkk2 null mice \r\n      have a high proliferative capability when stimulated in vitro in the presence of \r\n      BM-derived endothelial cells. In addition, Camkk2 null mice are more resistant to \r\n      radiation injury and show accelerated hematopoietic recovery, enhanced HSPC \r\n      regeneration and ultimately a prolonged survival following sublethal or lethal \r\n      total body irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that CaMKK2 regulates the \r\n      HSPC response to hematopoietic damage by coupling radiation signaling to \r\n      activation of the anti-proliferative AMP-activated protein kinase. Finally, we \r\n      demonstrated that systemic administration of the small molecule CaMKK2 inhibitor, \r\n      STO-609, to irradiated mice enhanced HSPC recovery and improved survival. These \r\n      findings identify CaMKK2 as an important regulator of HSPC regeneration and \r\n      demonstrate CaMKK2 inhibition is a novel approach to promoting hematopoietic \r\n      recovery after BM injury.\r\nFAU - Racioppi, Luigi\r\nAU  - Racioppi L\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nAD  - Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples \r\n      Federico II, Naples, Italy.\r\nFAU - Lento, William\r\nAU  - Lento W\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Huang, Wei\r\nAU  - Huang W\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Arvai, Stephanie\r\nAU  - Arvai S\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Doan, Phuong L\r\nAU  - Doan PL\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Harris, Jeffrey R\r\nAU  - Harris JR\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Marcon, Fernando\r\nAU  - Marcon F\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Liu, Yaping\r\nAU  - Liu Y\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nFAU - Chao, Nelson\r\nAU  - Chao N\r\nAD  - Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of \r\n      Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 CA014236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI067773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K08 CA184552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI067798/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nDEP - 20171005\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Cell Death Dis\r\nJT  - Cell death & disease\r\nJID - 101524092\r\nRN  - 0 (Benzimidazoles)\r\nRN  - 0 (Calmodulin)\r\nRN  - 0 (Naphthalimides)\r\nRN  - 0 (STO 609)\r\nRN  - 147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.17 (Camkk2 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage\r\nMH  - Calcium/metabolism\r\nMH  - Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase/*genetics\r\nMH  - Calmodulin/*genetics\r\nMH  - Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics\r\nMH  - Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Naphthalimides/administration & dosage\r\nMH  - Radiation Injuries/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology\r\nMH  - Regeneration/genetics\r\nMH  - Signal Transduction/drug effects\r\nMH  - Whole-Body Irradiation\r\nPMC - PMC5680595\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2017/10/06 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2018/06/09 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2017/10/01\r\nCRDT- 2017/10/06 06:00\r\nPHST- 2017/07/02 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2017/08/04 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/06 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2018/06/09 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - cddis2017474 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1038/cddis.2017.474 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Cell Death Dis. 2017 Oct 5;8(10):e3076. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.474.\r\n\r\nPMID- 28003350\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20170606\r\nLR  - 20220317\r\nIS  - 1537-6613 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0022-1899 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0022-1899 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 215\r\nIP  - 3\r\nDP  - 2017 Feb 1\r\nTI  - Blood Gene Signatures of Chagas Cardiomyopathy With or Without Ventricular \r\n      Dysfunction.\r\nPG  - 387-395\r\nLID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw540 [doi]\r\nAB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 7 \r\n      million people in Latin American areas of endemicity. About 30% of infected \r\n      patients will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory \r\n      cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocarditis. Further \r\n      studies are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease \r\n      progression. Transcriptome analysis has been increasingly used to identify \r\n      molecular changes associated with disease outcomes. We thus assessed the \r\n      whole-blood transcriptome of patients with Chagas disease. Microarray analysis \r\n      was performed on blood samples from 150 subjects, of whom 30 were uninfected \r\n      control patients and 120 had Chagas disease (1 group had asymptomatic disease, \r\n      and 2 groups had CCC with either a preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection \r\n      fraction [LVEF]). Each Chagas disease group displayed distinct gene expression \r\n      and functional pathway profiles. The most different expression patterns were \r\n      between CCC groups with a preserved or reduced LVEF. A more stringent analysis \r\n      indicated that 27 differentially expressed genes, particularly those related to \r\n      natural killer (NK)/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, separated the 2 groups. NK/CD8+ \r\n      T-cell cytotoxicity could play a role in determining Chagas disease progression. \r\n      Understanding genes associated with disease may lead to improved insight into CCC \r\n      pathogenesis and the identification of prognostic factors for CCC progression.\r\nCI  - © The Author 2016.

The diagnosis of the acute form of the disease is performed by trained \r\n      microscopists who detect parasites in blood smear samples. Since this method \r\n      requires a dedicated high-resolution camera system attached to the microscope, \r\n      the diagnostic method is more expensive and often prohibitive for low-income \r\n      settings. Here, we present a machine learning approach based on a random forest \r\n      (RF) algorithm for the detection and counting of T. cruzi trypomastigotes in \r\n      mobile phone images. We analyzed micrographs of blood smear samples that were \r\n      acquired using a mobile device camera capable of capturing images in a resolution \r\n      of 12 megapixels. We extracted a set of features that describe morphometric \r\n      parameters (geometry and curvature), as well as color, and texture measurements \r\n      of 1,314 parasites. The features were divided into train and test sets (4:1) and \r\n      classified using the RF algorithm. The values of precision, sensitivity, and area \r\n      under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the proposed method \r\n      were 87.6%, 90.5%, and 0.942, respectively. Automating image analysis acquired \r\n      with a mobile device is a viable alternative for reducing costs and gaining \r\n      efficiency in the use of the optical microscope.\r\nCI  - ©2022 Morais et al.\r\nFAU - Morais, Mauro César Cafundó\r\nAU  - Morais MCC\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of São Paulo (SPPU), Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, Diogo\r\nAU  - Silva D\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Milagre, Matheus Marques\r\nAU  - Milagre MM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas (DEACL), Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas (CiPHARMA), Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Oliveira, Maykon Tavares\r\nAU  - de Oliveira MT\r\nAD  - Fiocruz- Bi-Institutional Translational Medicine Project, FIOCRUZ/SP, Ribeirão \r\n      Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pereira, Thaís\r\nAU  - Pereira T\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Imunopatologia, Instituto René Rachou, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, \r\n      Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, João Santana\r\nAU  - Silva JS\r\nAD  - Fiocruz- Bi-Institutional Translational Medicine Project, FIOCRUZ/SP, Ribeirão \r\n      Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Costa, Luciano da F\r\nAU  - Costa LDF\r\nAD  - São Carlos Institute of Physics (DFCM- IFSC), Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Carlos, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Minoprio, Paola\r\nAU  - Minoprio P\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of São Paulo (SPPU), Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Junior, Roberto Marcondes Cesar\r\nAU  - Junior RMC\r\nAD  - Instituto de Matemática e Estatística (IME), Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gazzinelli, Ricardo\r\nAU  - Gazzinelli R\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Imunopatologia, Instituto René Rachou, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, \r\n      Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Lana, Marta\r\nAU  - de Lana M\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas (DEACL), Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas (CiPHARMA), Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Núcleo de Pesquisas em Ciências Biológicas (NUPEB), Universidade Federal de Ouro \r\n      Preto, Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of São Paulo (SPPU), Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20220527\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PeerJ\r\nJT  - PeerJ\r\nJID - 101603425\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - *Trypanosoma cruzi\r\nMH  - *Parasites\r\nMH  - *Chagas Disease/diagnosis\r\nMH  - ROC Curve\r\nMH  - *Cell Phone\r\nPMC - PMC9150695\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Blood trypomastigote\r\nOT  - Machine learning\r\nOT  - Parasitemia\r\nOT  - SVM\r\nOT  - Trypanosoma cruzi\r\nCOIS- Helder I.

In \r\n      macrophages, pro-inflammatory stimuli usually induce SerpinB2; however, \r\n      expression is constitutive in Gata6+ large peritoneal macrophages (LPM). \r\n      Interrogation of expression data from human macrophages treated with a range of \r\n      stimuli using a new bioinformatics tool, CEMiTool, suggested that SerpinB2 is \r\n      most tightly co- and counter-regulated with genes associated with cell movement. \r\n      Using LPM from SerpinB2(-/-) and SerpinB2(R380A) (active site mutant) mice, we \r\n      show that migration on Matrigel was faster than for their wild-type controls. \r\n      Confocal microscopy illustrated that SerpinB2 and F-actin staining overlapped in \r\n      focal adhesions and lamellipodia. Genes associated with migration and \r\n      extracellular matrix interactions were also identified by RNA-Seq analysis of \r\n      migrating RPM from wild-type and SerpinB2(R380A) mice. Subsequent gene set \r\n      enrichment analyses (GSEA) suggested SerpinB2 counter-regulates many \r\n      Gata6-regulated genes associated with migration. These data argue that the role \r\n      of SerpinB2 in macrophages is inhibition of uPA-mediated plasmin generation \r\n      during cell migration. GSEA also suggested that SerpinB2 expression (likely via \r\n      ensuing modulation of uPA-receptor/integrin signaling) promotes the adoption of a \r\n      resolution phase signature.\r\nFAU - Schroder, Wayne A\r\nAU  - Schroder WA\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Hirata, Thiago D\r\nAU  - Hirata TD\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3967-8121\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Le, Thuy T\r\nAU  - Le TT\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Gardner, Joy\r\nAU  - Gardner J\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Boyle, Glen M\r\nAU  - Boyle GM\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Ellis, Jonathan\r\nAU  - Ellis J\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Nakayama, Eri\r\nAU  - Nakayama E\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0826-3513\r\nAD  - Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, \r\n      162-8640, Japan.\r\nFAU - Pathirana, Dilan\r\nAU  - Pathirana D\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Suhrbier, Andreas\r\nAU  - Suhrbier A\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8986-9025\r\nAD  - QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Qld, 4029, Australia. \r\n      Andreas.Suhrbier@qimrberghofer.edu.au.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20190827\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Sci Rep\r\nJT  - Scientific reports\r\nJID - 101563288\r\nRN  - 0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)\r\nRN  - EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - *Cell Movement\r\nMH  - Extracellular Matrix/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/genetics/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism\r\nPMC - PMC6712035\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no competing interests.\r\nEDAT- 2019/08/29 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2020/10/22 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2019/08/27\r\nCRDT- 2019/08/29 06:00\r\nPHST- 2018/10/22 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2019/08/27 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41598-019-48741-w [pii]\r\nAID - 48741 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41598-019-48741-w [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 27;9(1):12421. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-48741-w.\r\n\r\nPMID- 31399544\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20200323\r\nLR  - 20200323\r\nIS  - 1091-6490 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0027-8424 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0027-8424 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 116\r\nIP  - 34\r\nDP  - 2019 Aug 20\r\nTI  - Long noncoding RNAs are involved in multiple immunological pathways in response \r\n      to vaccination.\r\nPG  - 17121-17126\r\nLID - 10.1073/pnas.1822046116 [doi]\r\nAB  - Understanding the mechanisms of vaccine-elicited protection contributes to the \r\n      development of new vaccines. The emerging field of systems vaccinology provides \r\n      detailed information on host responses to vaccination and has been successfully \r\n      applied to study the molecular mechanisms of several vaccines. Long noncoding \r\n      RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucially involved in multiple biological processes, but their \r\n      role in vaccine-induced immunity has not been explored. We performed an analysis \r\n      of over 2,000 blood transcriptome samples from 17 vaccine cohorts to identify \r\n      lncRNAs potentially involved with antibody responses to influenza and yellow \r\n      fever vaccines. We have created an online database where all results from this \r\n      analysis can be accessed easily. We found that lncRNAs participate in distinct \r\n      immunological pathways related to vaccine-elicited responses. Among them, we \r\n      showed that the expression of lncRNA FAM30A was high in B cells and correlates \r\n      with the expression of immunoglobulin genes located in its genomic vicinity. We \r\n      also identified altered expression of these lncRNAs in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) \r\n      data from a cohort of children following immunization with intranasal live \r\n      attenuated influenza vaccine, suggesting a common role across several diverse \r\n      vaccines. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that lncRNAs have a \r\n      significant impact on immune responses induced by vaccination.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

A high \r\n      fiber diet has been widely promoted for its ability to ameliorate inflammatory \r\n      diseases. Fiber is fermented in the gut into short chain fatty acids such as \r\n      acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which enter the circulation providing systemic \r\n      anti-inflammatory activities. Herein we show that mice fed a high fiber diet show \r\n      a clear exacerbation of CHIKV arthropathy, with increased edema and neutrophil \r\n      infiltrates. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that a high fiber diet, in this \r\n      setting, promoted a range of pro-neutrophil responses including Th17/IL-17. Gene \r\n      Set Enrichment Analyses demonstrated significant similarities with mouse models \r\n      of inflammatory psoriasis and significant depression of macrophage resolution \r\n      phase signatures in the CHIKV arthritic lesions from mice fed a high fiber diet. \r\n      Supplementation of the drinking water with butyrate also increased edema after \r\n      CHIKV infection. However, the mechanisms involved were different, with modulation \r\n      of AP-1 and NF-κB responses identified, potentially implicating deoptimization of \r\n      endothelial barrier repair. Thus, neither fiber nor short chain fatty acids \r\n      provided benefits in this acute infectious disease setting, which is \r\n      characterized by widespread viral cytopathic effects and a need for tissue \r\n      repair.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2019 Prow, Hirata, Tang, Larcher, Mukhopadhyay, Alves, Le, Gardner, \r\n      Poo, Nakayama, Lutzky, Nakaya and Suhrbier.\r\nFAU - Prow, Natalie A\r\nAU  - Prow NA\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nAD  - Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre, University of Queensland, \r\n      Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\r\nFAU - Hirata, Thiago D C\r\nAU  - Hirata TDC\r\nAD  - Computational Systems Biology Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Tang, Bing\r\nAU  - Tang B\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Larcher, Thibaut\r\nAU  - Larcher T\r\nAD  - Institut National de Recherche Agronomique, Unité Mixte de Recherche 703, Oniris, \r\n      Nantes, France.\r\nFAU - Mukhopadhyay, Pamela\r\nAU  - Mukhopadhyay P\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Alves, Tiago Lubiana\r\nAU  - Alves TL\r\nAD  - Computational Systems Biology Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Le, Thuy T\r\nAU  - Le TT\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Gardner, Joy\r\nAU  - Gardner J\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Poo, Yee Suan\r\nAU  - Poo YS\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Nakayama, Eri\r\nAU  - Nakayama E\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nAD  - Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, \r\n      Japan.\r\nFAU - Lutzky, Viviana P\r\nAU  - Lutzky VP\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Computational Systems Biology Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Suhrbier, Andreas\r\nAU  - Suhrbier A\r\nAD  - Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, \r\n      Australia.\r\nAD  - Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre, University of Queensland, \r\n      Brisbane, QLD, Australia.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20191126\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 0 (Butyrates)\r\nRN  - 0 (Dietary Fiber)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Butyrates/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nMH  - Chikungunya Fever/complications/*immunology\r\nMH  - Chikungunya virus/*physiology\r\nMH  - Diet\r\nMH  - Dietary Fiber/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nMH  - Disease Models, Animal\r\nMH  - Disease Progression\r\nMH  - Edema\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Inflammation/*etiology\r\nMH  - Joint Diseases\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Neutrophil Infiltration\r\nMH  - Neutrophils/*immunology\r\nMH  - Rheumatic Diseases/*etiology\r\nPMC - PMC6888101\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - arthritis\r\nOT  - chikungunya\r\nOT  - diet\r\nOT  - fiber\r\nOT  - immunopathology\r\nEDAT- 2019/12/19 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2020/11/11 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2019/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2019/12/19 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/07/26 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2019/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02736 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Immunol. 2019 Nov 26;10:2736. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02736. eCollection \r\n      2019.\r\n\r\nPMID- 31610635\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20210121\r\nLR  - 20210121\r\nIS  - 1651-2227 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0803-5253 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 109\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2020 Jan\r\nTI  - Biological sex influences antibody responses to routine vaccinations in the first \r\n      year of life.\r\nPG  - 147-157\r\nLID - 10.1111/apa.14932 [doi]\r\nAB  - AIM: We investigated the effect of early-life factors, namely sex, delivery mode, \r\n      feeding method and antibiotic exposure, on antibody responses to routine \r\n      vaccinations administered during the first year of life. METHODS: One and seven \r\n      months after the primary course of routine vaccines and 1 month after routine \r\n      vaccines at 12 months of age, antibodies against 26 vaccine antigens were \r\n      measured in 398 healthy infants. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of \r\n      antibodies (adjusted for effect modifiers with multiple linear regression) and \r\n      the seroprotection rate for each vaccine were compared for each early-life \r\n      factor. RESULTS: Sex had an influence on GMCs. Antibody concentrations were \r\n      significantly lower at 7 months of age in females for tetanus and filamentous \r\n      haemagglutinin and at 13 months of age for pertactin. In contrast, at 13 months \r\n      of age, antibody concentrations were significantly higher in females for polio \r\n      type 3, pneumococcal serotype 6A and measles. Sex did not have an influence on \r\n      seroprotection rates.

Despite its efficacy and widespread use in more than 600 \r\n      million people, the mechanisms by which it stimulates protective immunity remain \r\n      poorly understood. Recent studies using systems biology approaches in humans have \r\n      revealed that YF-17D-induced early expression of general control nonderepressible \r\n      2 kinase (GCN2) in the blood strongly correlates with the magnitude of the later \r\n      CD8(+) T cell response. We demonstrate a key role for virus-induced GCN2 \r\n      activation in programming dendritic cells to initiate autophagy and enhanced \r\n      antigen presentation to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results reveal an \r\n      unappreciated link between virus-induced integrated stress response in dendritic \r\n      cells and the adaptive immune response.\r\nFAU - Ravindran, Rajesh\r\nAU  -

Experiments \r\n      with animal models and in vitro systems have substantially contributed to our \r\n      understanding of the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection. Here, to investigate the \r\n      molecular basis of CZS in humans, we used a systems biology approach to integrate \r\n      transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic data from the postmortem brains of \r\n      neonates with CZS. We observed that collagens were greatly reduced in expression \r\n      in CZS brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS had \r\n      several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in collagen-encoding genes that are \r\n      associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. These findings were \r\n      validated by immunohistochemistry and comparative analysis of collagen abundance \r\n      in ZIKV-infected and uninfected samples. In addition, we showed a ZIKV-dependent \r\n      increase in the expression of cell adhesion factors that are essential for \r\n      neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, findings that are consistent with the \r\n      neuronal migration defects observed in CZS. Together, these findings provide \r\n      insights into the underlying molecular alterations in the ZIKV-infected brain and \r\n      reveal host genes associated with CZS susceptibility.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American \r\n      Association for the Advancement of Science.

To elucidate their impact on the immune system, a COVID-19 vaccination \r\n      atlas was developed using an integrative systems vaccinology approach. The atlas \r\n      includes 562 samples from 245 participants, including both healthy individuals \r\n      and those infected with or without prior vaccination, and covers the \r\n      administration of five vaccines in different regimens. Key findings include the \r\n      identification of distinct immune markers that differentiate between vaccine \r\n      types and infection statuses. We observed that mRNA vaccines induced transient \r\n      but strong immune responses after booster doses, whereas viral vector vaccines \r\n      showed sustained immune activation with infection, partially resembling the \r\n      immune profile exhibited during infection. Heterologous vaccination regimens \r\n      demonstrated enhanced immune diversification compared to homologous regimens. \r\n      Finally, we described the immunological landscape of COVID-19 vaccines and \r\n      vaccines against other pathogens, at the gene-level and in cell population \r\n      dynamics.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

Recently, gene \r\n      expression profiles of PBMC samples in vaccinated individuals have been used to \r\n      predict the development of protective immunity. However, the magnitude of change \r\n      in gene expression that separates vaccine responders and nonresponders is likely \r\n      to be small and distributed across networks of genes, making the selection of \r\n      predictive and biologically relevant genes difficult. Here we apply a new \r\n      approach to predicting vaccine response based on coordinated upregulation of sets \r\n      of biologically informative genes in postvaccination gene expression profiles. We \r\n      found that enrichment of gene sets related to proliferation and immunoglobulin \r\n      genes accurately segregated high responders to influenza vaccination from low \r\n      responders and achieved a prediction accuracy of 88% in an independent clinical \r\n      trial. Many of the genes in these gene sets would not have been identified using \r\n      conventional, single-gene level approaches because of their subtle upregulation \r\n      in vaccine responders. Our results demonstrate that gene set enrichment method \r\n      can capture subtle transcriptional changes and may be a generally useful approach \r\n      for developing and interpreting predictive models of the human immune response.\r\nCI  - © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Vaccination of Trl5(-/-) mice \r\n      resulted in reduced antibody titers and lower frequencies of plasma cells, \r\n      demonstrating a role for TLR5 in immunity to TIV. This was due to a failure to \r\n      sense host microbiota. Thus, antibody responses in germ-free or \r\n      antibiotic-treated mice were impaired, but restored by oral reconstitution with a \r\n      flagellated, but not aflagellated, strain of E. coli. TLR5-mediated sensing of \r\n      flagellin promoted plasma cell differentiation directly and by stimulating lymph \r\n      node macrophages to produce plasma cell growth factors. Finally, TLR5-mediated \r\n      sensing of the microbiota also impacted antibody responses to the inactivated \r\n      polio vaccine, but not to adjuvanted vaccines or the live-attenuated yellow fever \r\n      vaccine. These results reveal an unappreciated role for gut microbiota in \r\n      promoting immunity to vaccination.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about the \r\n      molecular mechanisms driving vaccine immunity. Here, we applied a systems biology \r\n      approach to study immune responses in subjects receiving three consecutive \r\n      immunizations with RTS,S (RRR), or in those receiving two immunizations of \r\n      RTS,S/AS01 following a primary immunization with adenovirus 35 (Ad35) (ARR) \r\n      vector expressing circumsporozoite protein. Subsequent controlled human malaria \r\n      challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after \r\n      the final immunization, resulted in ∼50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. \r\n      Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were \r\n      associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower \r\n      antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4(+) \r\n      T-cell responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and \r\n      plasma cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers \r\n      prechallenge and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of \r\n      innate immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with \r\n      protection in the ARR cohort. For both vaccine regimens, natural killer (NK) cell \r\n      signatures negatively correlated with and predicted protection. These results \r\n      suggest that protective immunity against P. falciparum can be achieved via \r\n      multiple mechanisms and highlight the utility of systems approaches in defining \r\n      molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.\r\nFAU - Kazmin, Dmitri\r\nAU  - Kazmin D\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo 05508, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lee, Eva K\r\nAU  - Lee EK\r\nAD  - School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30332.\r\nFAU - Johnson, Matthew J\r\nAU  - Johnson MJ\r\nAD  - Center for Genome Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55108.\r\nFAU - van der Most, Robbert\r\nAU  - van der Most R\r\nAD  - GSK Vaccines, Rixensart 1330, Belgium.\r\nFAU - van den Berg, Robert A\r\nAU  - van den Berg RA\r\nAD  - GSK Vaccines, Rockville, MD 20850.\r\nFAU - Ballou, W Ripley\r\nAU  - Ballou WR\r\nAD  - GSK Vaccines, Rockville, MD 20850.\r\nFAU - Jongert, Erik\r\nAU  - Jongert E\r\nAD  - GSK Vaccines, Rixensart 1330, Belgium.\r\nFAU - Wille-Reece, Ulrike\r\nAU  - Wille-Reece U\r\nAD  - Program for Appropriate Technology in Health-Malaria Vaccine Initiative, \r\n      Washington, DC 20001.\r\nFAU - Ockenhouse, Christian\r\nAU  - Ockenhouse C\r\nAD  - Program for Appropriate Technology in Health-Malaria Vaccine Initiative, \r\n      Washington, DC 20001.\r\nFAU - Aderem, Alan\r\nAU  - Aderem A\r\nAD  - Center for Infectious Disease Research, Seattle, WA 98109.\r\nFAU - Zak, Daniel E\r\nAU  - Zak DE\r\nAD  - Center for Infectious Disease Research, Seattle, WA 98109.\r\nFAU - Sadoff, Jerald\r\nAU  - Sadoff J\r\nAD  - Crucell, Leiden 2333, The Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Hendriks, Jenny\r\nAU  - Hendriks J\r\nAD  - Crucell, Leiden 2333, The Netherlands.\r\nFAU - Wrammert, Jens\r\nAU  - Wrammert J\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329.\r\nFAU - Ahmed, Rafi\r\nAU  - Ahmed R\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329; bpulend@emory.edu \r\n      rahmed@emory.edu.\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329; bpulend@emory.edu \r\n      rahmed@emory.edu.\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P51 OD011132/OD/NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Clinical Trial\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.\r\nDEP - 20170213\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\r\nJT  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\r\nJID - 7505876\r\nRN  - 0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)\r\nRN  - 0 (Malaria Vaccines)\r\nRN  - 0 (Protozoan Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (RTS,S-AS01 vaccine)\r\nRN  - 0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)\r\nRN  - 0 (circumsporozoite protein, Protozoan)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adaptive Immunity/*drug effects\r\nMH  - Adenoviridae/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - Antibodies, Protozoan/*biosynthesis\r\nMH  - B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation\r\nMH  - Genetic Vectors/chemistry/immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Immunity, Innate/*drug effects\r\nMH  - Immunization, Secondary/methods\r\nMH  - Immunogenicity, Vaccine\r\nMH  - Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Malaria Vaccines/*administration & dosage\r\nMH  - Malaria, Falciparum/*immunology/parasitology/prevention & control\r\nMH  - Plasmodium falciparum/immunology/pathogenicity\r\nMH  - Protozoan Proteins/*administration & dosage/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - Vaccination/methods\r\nMH  - Vaccines, Synthetic/*administration & dosage\r\nPMC - PMC5338562\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - immune\r\nOT  - malaria\r\nOT  - systems biology\r\nOT  - systems vaccinology\r\nOT  - vaccine\r\nCOIS- Conflict of interest statement: R.v.d.M., R.A.v.d.B., W.R.B., and E.J. are \r\n      employees of the GSK group of companies.

Here we consider promoter conservation and \r\n      positional conservation as indicators of functional commonality. RESULTS: We \r\n      identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human that are preserved in \r\n      genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. These positionally \r\n      conserved lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription \r\n      factor loci with which they are coexpressed in a tissue-specific manner. Over \r\n      half of positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to chromatin \r\n      organization structures, overlapping binding sites for the CTCF chromatin \r\n      organiser and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of \r\n      topologically associating domains (TADs). We define these RNAs as topological \r\n      anchor point RNAs (tapRNAs). Characterization of these noncoding RNAs and their \r\n      associated coding genes shows that they are functionally connected: they regulate \r\n      each other's expression and influence the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells in \r\n      vitro in a similar fashion. Furthermore, we find that tapRNAs contain conserved \r\n      sequence domains that are enriched in motifs for zinc finger domain-containing \r\n      RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors, whose binding sites are found \r\n      mutated in cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This work leverages positional conservation to \r\n      identify lncRNAs with potential importance in genome organization, development \r\n      and disease. The evidence that many developmental transcription factors are \r\n      physically and functionally connected to lncRNAs represents an exciting \r\n      stepping-stone to further our understanding of genome regulation.\r\nFAU - Amaral, Paulo P\r\nAU  - Amaral PP\r\nAD  - The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 \r\n      1QN, UK.\r\nFAU - Leonardi, Tommaso\r\nAU  - Leonardi T\r\nAD  - European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute \r\n      (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SD, UK.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Neurosciences and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, \r\n      University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\r\nFAU - Han, Namshik\r\nAU  - Han N\r\nAD  - The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 \r\n      1QN, UK.\r\nAD  - Present address: The Milner Therapeutics Institute, University of Cambridge, \r\n      Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1QN, UK.\r\nFAU - Viré, Emmanuelle\r\nAU  - Viré E\r\nAD  - Present address: MRC Prion Unit, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square House, \r\n      Queen Square, London, WC1N 3BG, UK.\r\nFAU - Gascoigne, Dennis K\r\nAU  - Gascoigne DK\r\nAD  - The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 \r\n      1QN, UK.\r\nFAU - Arias-Carrasco, Raúl\r\nAU  - Arias-Carrasco R\r\nAD  - Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Mayor, \r\n      Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Büscher, Magdalena\r\nAU  - Büscher M\r\nAD  - The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 \r\n      1QN, UK.\r\nFAU - Pandolfini, Luca\r\nAU  - Pandolfini L\r\nAD  - The Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 \r\n      1QN, UK.\r\nFAU - Zhang, Anda\r\nAU  - Zhang A\r\nAD  - University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer \r\n      Center, Department of Human Genetics, Biomedical Research Building, Miami, FL, \r\n      33136, USA.\r\nFAU - Pluchino, Stefano\r\nAU  - Pluchino S\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Neurosciences and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, \r\n      University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\r\nFAU - Maracaja-Coutinho, Vinicius\r\nAU  - Maracaja-Coutinho V\r\nAD  - Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Mayor, \r\n      Santiago, Chile.\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Av.

Neurodegenerative processes may be exacerbated by \r\n      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent neuronal excitoxicity. Here, we \r\n      have exploited the hypothesis that ZIKV-induced neurodegeneration can be rescued \r\n      by blocking NMDA overstimulation with memantine. Our results show that ZIKV \r\n      actively replicates in primary neurons and that virus replication is directly \r\n      associated with massive neuronal cell death. Interestingly, treatment with \r\n      memantine or other NMDAR blockers, including dizocilpine (MK-801), agmatine \r\n      sulfate, or ifenprodil, prevents neuronal death without interfering with the \r\n      ability of ZIKV to replicate in these cells. Moreover, in vivo experiments \r\n      demonstrate that therapeutic memantine treatment prevents the increase of \r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) induced by infection and massively reduces \r\n      neurodegeneration and microgliosis in the brain of infected mice. Our results \r\n      indicate that the blockade of NMDARs by memantine provides potent neuroprotective \r\n      effects against ZIKV-induced neuronal damage, suggesting it could be a viable \r\n      treatment for patients at risk for ZIKV infection-induced \r\n      neurodegeneration.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global health \r\n      emergency associated with serious neurological complications, including \r\n      microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Infection of experimental animals with \r\n      ZIKV causes significant neuronal damage and microgliosis. Treatment with drugs \r\n      that block NMDARs prevented neuronal damage both in vitro and in vivo These \r\n      results suggest that overactivation of NMDARs contributes significantly to the \r\n      neuronal damage induced by ZIKV infection, and this is amenable to inhibition by \r\n      drug treatment.\r\nCI  -

However, its mechanism \r\n      of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target \r\n      genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences \r\n      glioblastoma phenotypes, we conducted individual-nucleotide resolution \r\n      cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1 \r\n      has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context, \r\n      especially in 3' untranslated regions. Although numerous binding sites were also \r\n      identified in intronic sequences, our RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis does \r\n      not favor the idea that MSI1 is a major regulator of splicing in glioblastoma \r\n      cells. MSI1 target mRNAs encode proteins that function in multiple pathways of \r\n      cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Since these associations indicate \r\n      potentially new roles for MSI1, we investigated its impact on glioblastoma cell \r\n      adhesion, morphology, migration, and invasion. These processes are known to \r\n      underpin the spread and relapse of glioblastoma, in contrast to other tumors \r\n      where metastasis is the main driver of recurrence and progression.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Here, we \r\n      demonstrated that T-cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling is required for proliferation, \r\n      protection from apoptosis and expression of activation/memory genes during \r\n      infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, as evidenced by \r\n      transcriptome and cytometry analyses in mixed bone-marrow (BM) chimeras. The lack \r\n      of direct IL-18R signaling in T cells, but not of IL-1R, phenocopied the absence \r\n      of the MyD88 pathway, indicating that IL-18R is a critical MyD88-upstream pathway \r\n      involved in the establishment of the Th1 response against an in vivo infection, a \r\n      presently controvert subject. Accordingly, Il18r1(-/-) mice display lower levels \r\n      of Th1 cells and are highly susceptible to infection, but can be rescued from \r\n      mortality by the adoptive transfer of WT CD4(+) T cells. Our findings establish \r\n      the T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 pathway as a crucial element for induction of \r\n      cognate Th1 responses against an important human pathogen.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Ana-Carolina\r\nAU  - Oliveira AC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0036-3720\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gomes-Neto, João Francisco\r\nAU  - Gomes-Neto JF\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Barbosa, Carlos-Henrique Dantas\r\nAU  - Barbosa CD\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Granato, Alessandra\r\nAU  - Granato A\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Reis, Bernardo S\r\nAU  - Reis BS\r\nAD  - The Rockefeller University, New York, United States.\r\nFAU - Santos, Bruno Maia\r\nAU  - Santos BM\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fucs, Rita\r\nAU  - Fucs R\r\nAD  - Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Canto, Fábio B\r\nAU  - Canto FB\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Vacinas, CNPq-MCT, Belo Horizonte, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, United \r\n      States.\r\nFAU - Nóbrega, Alberto\r\nAU  - Nóbrega A\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bellio, Maria\r\nAU  - Bellio M\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3360-2740\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, \r\n      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Vacinas, CNPq-MCT, Belo Horizonte, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20170912\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Elife\r\nJT  - eLife\r\nJID - 101579614\r\nRN  - 0 (Il18r1 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit)\r\nRN  - 0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adoptive Transfer\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Chagas Disease/*immunology/therapy\r\nMH  - Disease Models, Animal\r\nMH  - Flow Cytometry\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*metabolism\r\nMH  - *Signal Transduction\r\nMH  - Survival Analysis\r\nMH  - Th1 Cells/*immunology/*parasitology\r\nMH  - Trypanosoma cruzi/*immunology\r\nPMC - PMC5629024\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - MyD88\r\nOT  - Th1\r\nOT  - Trypanosoma cruzi\r\nOT  - immunology\r\nOT  - mouse\r\nCOIS- No competing interests declared.\r\nEDAT- 2017/09/13 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2018/05/23 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2017/09/12\r\nCRDT- 2017/09/13 06:00\r\nPHST- 2017/07/30 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2017/09/12 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2017/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2017/09/13 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2017/09/12 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 30883 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.7554/eLife.30883 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Elife. 2017 Sep 12;6:e30883. doi: 10.7554/eLife.30883.\r\n\r\nPMID- 33863789\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20210825\r\nLR  - 20240531\r\nIS  - 1550-6606 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0022-1767 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0022-1767 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 206\r\nIP  - 9\r\nDP  - 2021 May 1\r\nTI  - Kdm6b Regulates the Generation of Effector CD8(+) T Cells by Inducing Chromatin \r\n      Accessibility in Effector-Associated Genes.\r\nPG  - 2170-2183\r\nLID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2001459 [doi]\r\nAB  - The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of CD8(+) T cell differentiation is \r\n      critical for balancing pathogen eradication and long-term immunity by effector \r\n      and memory CTLs, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that the lysine \r\n      demethylase 6b (Kdm6b) is essential for the proper generation and function of \r\n      effector CD8(+) T cells during acute infection and tumor eradication. We found \r\n      that cells lacking Kdm6b (by either T cell-specific knockout mice or knockdown \r\n      using short hairpin RNA strategies) show an enhanced generation of memory \r\n      precursor and early effector cells upon acute viral infection in a cell-intrinsic \r\n      manner. We also demonstrate that Kdm6b is indispensable for proper effector \r\n      functions and tumor protection, and that memory CD8(+) T cells lacking Kdm6b \r\n      displayed a defective recall response. Mechanistically, we identified that Kdm6b, \r\n      through induction of chromatin accessibility in key effector-associated gene \r\n      loci, allows for the proper generation of effector CTLs. Our results pinpoint the \r\n      essential function of Kdm6b in allowing chromatin accessibility in \r\n      effector-associated genes, and identify Kdm6b as a potential target for \r\n      therapeutics in diseases with dysregulated effector responses.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.\r\nFAU - Xu, Tianhao\r\nAU  - Xu T\r\nAD  - Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection, Chicago Medical School, \r\n      Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL.\r\nAD  - Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, Chicago Medical School, Rosalind \r\n      Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL.\r\nFAU - Schutte, Alexander\r\nAU  - Schutte A\r\nAD  - Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection, Chicago Medical School, \r\n      Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL.\r\nFAU - Jimenez, Leandro\r\nAU  - Jimenez L\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2544-1964\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, Andre N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5264-8368\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Keller, Ashleigh\r\nAU  - Keller A\r\nAD  - Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection, Chicago Medical School, \r\n      Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL.\r\nFAU - Pipkin, Matthew E\r\nAU  - Pipkin ME\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, \r\n      Jupiter, FL.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pereira, Renata M\r\nAU  - Pereira RM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7719-8356\r\nAD  - Instituto de Microbiologia Prof. Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de \r\n      Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martinez, Gustavo J\r\nAU  - Martinez GJ\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0178-3329\r\nAD  - Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection, Chicago Medical School, \r\n      Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL; \r\n      gustavo.martinez@rosalindfranklin.edu.\r\nAD  - Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, Chicago Medical School, Rosalind \r\n      Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - P01 AI145815/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - S10 OD025052/OD/NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI109976/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20210416\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - J Immunol\r\nJT  - Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)\r\nJID - 2985117R\r\nRN  - 0 (Chromatin)\r\nRN  - EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)\r\nRN  - EC 1.5.- (Kdm6b protein, mouse)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology\r\nMH  - Cells, Cultured\r\nMH  - Chromatin/genetics/*immunology\r\nMH  - Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*immunology\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Mice, Transgenic\r\nPMC - PMC11139061\r\nMID - NIHMS1857518\r\nCOIS- Disclosures The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2021/04/18 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/08/26 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2024/05/30\r\nCRDT- 2021/04/17 05:39\r\nPHST- 2020/12/28 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2021/04/17 05:39 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2024/05/30 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - jimmunol.2001459 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2001459 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - J Immunol. 2021 May 1;206(9):2170-2183. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2001459.

However, if this \r\n      occurs in Plasmodium vivax malaria is unclear. As platelets have been reported to \r\n      be activated and to play a role in inflammatory response during malaria, we \r\n      hypothesized that this would correlate with endothelial alterations during acute \r\n      illness. We performed platelet flow cytometry of PAC-1 and P-selectin. We \r\n      measured platelet markers (CXCL4, CD40L, P-selectin, Thrombopoietin, IL-11) and \r\n      endothelial activation markers (ICAM-1, von Willebrand Factor and E-selectin) in \r\n      plasma with a multiplex-based assay. The values of each mediator were used to \r\n      generate heatmaps, K-means clustering and Principal Component analysis. In \r\n      addition, we determined pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficients to generate \r\n      correlation networks. Platelet counts were reduced, and mean platelet volume \r\n      increased in malaria patients. The activation of circulating platelets in flow \r\n      cytometry did not differ between patients and controls. CD40L levels (Median \r\n      [IQ]: 517 [406-651] vs. 1029 [732-1267] pg/mL, P = 0.0001) were significantly \r\n      higher in patients, while P-selectin and CXCL4 showed a nonsignificant trend \r\n      towards higher levels in patients. The network correlation approach demonstrated \r\n      the correlation between markers of platelet and endothelial activation, and the \r\n      heatmaps revealed a distinct pattern of activation in two subsets of P. vivax \r\n      patients when compared to controls. Although absolute platelet activation was not \r\n      strong in uncomplicated vivax malaria, markers of platelet activity and \r\n      production were correlated with higher endothelial cell activation, especially in \r\n      a specific subset of patients.\r\nFAU - Dos-Santos, João Conrado Khouri\r\nAU  - Dos-Santos JCK\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5916-9845\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Doenças Tropicais-Prof. Luiz Jacintho da Silva.

Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the \r\n      control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of \r\n      uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with \r\n      publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood \r\n      leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and \r\n      young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially \r\n      expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a \r\n      stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between \r\n      upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This \r\n      was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, \r\n      while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The \r\n      association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a \r\n      strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced \r\n      transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as \r\n      CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1β, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with \r\n      male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory \r\n      damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways \r\n      associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a \r\n      possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and \r\n      neutrophil transcriptional signatures.\r\nFAU -

Here, we showed \r\n      evidence that LL-37 binds to gene promoter regions, and LL-37 gene silencing \r\n      changed the transcriptional program of melanoma A375 cells genes associated with \r\n      histone, metabolism, cellular stress, ubiquitination and mitochondria.\r\nFAU - Muñoz, Mindy\r\nAU  - Muñoz M\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Instituto de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Craske, Madeleine\r\nAU  - Craske M\r\nAD  - Active Motif Incorporation, Carlsbad, California, USA.\r\nFAU - Severino, Patricia\r\nAU  - Severino P\r\nAD  - Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Lima, Thais Martins\r\nAU  - de Lima TM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Emergências Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de \r\n      São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Labhart, Paul\r\nAU  - Labhart P\r\nAD  - Active Motif Incorporation, Carlsbad, California, USA.\r\nFAU - Chammas, Roger\r\nAU  - Chammas R\r\nAD  - Departamento de Oncologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Velasco, Irineu Tadeu\r\nAU  - Velasco IT\r\nAD  - Departamento de Emergências Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de \r\n      São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Machado, Marcel Cerqueira César\r\nAU  - Machado MC\r\nAD  - Departamento de Emergências Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de \r\n      São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Egan, Brian\r\nAU  - Egan B\r\nAD  - Active Motif Incorporation, Carlsbad, California, USA.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Departamento de Análises Clínicas e Toxicológicas, Instituto de Ciências \r\n      Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pinheiro da Silva, Fabiano\r\nAU  - Pinheiro da Silva F\r\nAD  - Departamento de Emergências Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de \r\n      São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20161126\r\nPL  - Australia\r\nTA  - J Cancer\r\nJT  - Journal of Cancer\r\nJID - 101535920\r\nPMC - PMC5166546\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - LL-37\r\nOT  - antimicrobial peptides\r\nOT  - cancer.\r\nOT  - transcription factors\r\nCOIS- The authors have no financial or ethical conflicts of interest to declare.\r\nEDAT- 2016/12/21 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2016/12/21 06:01\r\nPMCR- 2016/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2016/12/21 06:00\r\nPHST- 2016/07/22 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2016/09/30 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2016/12/21 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2016/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2016/12/21 06:01 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2016/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - jcav07p2341 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.7150/jca.16947 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - J Cancer. 2016 Nov 26;7(15):2341-2345. doi: 10.7150/jca.16947. eCollection 2016.\r\n\r\nPMID- 34312428\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20211103\r\nLR  - 20211103\r\nIS  - 2045-2322 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2045-2322 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 11\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2021 Jul 26\r\nTI  - Proteomics reveals disturbances in the immune response and energy metabolism of \r\n      monocytes from patients with septic shock.\r\nPG  - 15149\r\nLID - 10.1038/s41598-021-94474-0 [doi]\r\nLID - 15149\r\nAB  - Sepsis results from a dyshomeostatic response to infection, which may lead to \r\n      hyper or hypoimmune states. Monocytes are central regulators of the inflammatory \r\n      response, but our understanding of their role in the genesis and resolution of \r\n      sepsis is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive exploration of monocyte \r\n      molecular responses in a cohort of patients with septic shock via proteomic \r\n      profiling. The acute stage of septic shock was associated with an impaired \r\n      inflammatory phenotype, indicated by the down-regulation of MHC class II \r\n      molecules and proinflammatory cytokine pathways. Simultaneously, there was an \r\n      up-regulation of glycolysis enzymes and a decrease in proteins related to the \r\n      citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, the \r\n      restoration of immunocompetence was the hallmark of recovering patients, in which \r\n      an upregulation of interferon signaling pathways was a notable feature. Our \r\n      results provide insights into the immunopathology of sepsis and propose that, \r\n      pending future studies, immunometabolism pathway components could serve as \r\n      therapeutic targets in septic patients.\r\nCI  - © 2021.

Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 \r\n      display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without \r\n      comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and \r\n      hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here, we showed that patients \r\n      with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues \r\n      compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE \r\n      may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in \r\n      reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and higher viral load upon \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of 1,357 COVID-19 \r\n      patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to \r\n      3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs. Our work \r\n      suggests that pH has a great influence on SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 \r\n      severity.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 Jimenez, Campos Codo, Sampaio, Oliveira, Ferreira, Davanzo, \r\n      Brito Monteiro, Victor Virgilio-da-Silva, Borba, Fabiano de Souza, Zini, Andrade \r\n      Gandolfi, Muraro, Luiz Proença-Modena, Val, Cardoso Melo, Monteiro, Nogueira, \r\n      Lacerda, Moraes-Vieira and Nakaya.\r\nFAU -

523-527\r\nLID - 10.1038/nature17186 [doi]\r\nAB  - The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which \r\n      eukaryotic cells sense and respond to stress-inducing signals, such as amino acid \r\n      starvation. General controlled non-repressed (GCN2) kinase is a key orchestrator \r\n      of the ISR, and modulates protein synthesis in response to amino acid starvation. \r\n      Here we demonstrate in mice that GCN2 controls intestinal inflammation by \r\n      suppressing inflammasome activation. Enhanced activation of ISR was observed in \r\n      intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells during amino acid \r\n      starvation, or intestinal inflammation. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 (also known as \r\n      Eif2ka4) in CD11c(+) APCs or intestinal epithelial cells resulted in enhanced \r\n      intestinal inflammation and T helper 17 cell (TH17) responses, owing to enhanced \r\n      inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β production. This was caused by \r\n      reduced autophagy in Gcn2(-/-) intestinal APCs and epithelial cells, leading to \r\n      increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potent activator of inflammasomes. \r\n      Thus, conditional ablation of Atg5 or Atg7 in intestinal APCs resulted in \r\n      enhanced ROS and TH17 responses. Furthermore, in vivo blockade of ROS and IL-1β \r\n      resulted in inhibition of TH17 responses and reduced inflammation in Gcn2(-/-) \r\n      mice. Importantly, acute amino acid starvation suppressed intestinal inflammation \r\n      via a mechanism dependent on GCN2. These results reveal a mechanism that couples \r\n      amino acid sensing with control of intestinal inflammation via GCN2.\r\nFAU - Ravindran, Rajesh\r\nAU  - Ravindran R\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Loebbermann, Jens\r\nAU  - Loebbermann J\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Khan, Nooruddin\r\nAU  - Khan N\r\nAD  - Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, \r\n      University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.\r\nFAU - Ma, Hualing\r\nAU  - Ma H\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Gama, Leonardo\r\nAU  - Gama L\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Machiah, Deepa K\r\nAU  - Machiah DK\r\nAD  - Division of Pathology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood \r\n      Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Lawson, Benton\r\nAU  - Lawson B\r\nAD  - Virology Core, Emory Vaccine Center and Yerkes National Primate Research Center, \r\n      954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Hakimpour, Paul\r\nAU  - Hakimpour P\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Wang, Yi-Chong\r\nAU  - Wang YC\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Li, Shuzhao\r\nAU  - Li S\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Sharma, Prachi\r\nAU  - Sharma P\r\nAD  - Division of Pathology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood \r\n      Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Kaufman, Randal J\r\nAU  - Kaufman RJ\r\nAD  - Degenerative Disease Research, Sanford |Burnham Medical Research Institute 10901 \r\n      North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.\r\nFAU - Martinez, Jennifer\r\nAU  - Martinez J\r\nAD  - National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Mail Drop D2-01 Research \r\n      Triangle Park, NC 27709.\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, \r\n      Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK042394/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R56 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - ZIA ES103286/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 HL052173/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 DK103185/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 DK088227/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20160316\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Nature\r\nJT  - Nature\r\nJID - 0410462\r\nRN  - 0 (ATG5 protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (Amino Acids)\r\nRN  - 0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)\r\nRN  - 0 (Inflammasomes)\r\nRN  - 0 (Interleukin-1beta)\r\nRN  - 0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (Eif2ak4 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)\r\nRN  - EC 6.2.1.45 (ATG7 protein, human)\r\nRN  - EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)\r\nRN  - EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nCIN - Oncotarget. 2016 May 24;7(21):29877-8. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8841.

Mass spectrometry \r\n      revealed decreased IGHG-1 and increased ITIH2 protein levels in the GI group \r\n      compared with that in the NG group and higher serotransferrin in EVs in the DM \r\n      group than in those in the NG and GI groups. The GI group also showed increased \r\n      serum ferritin levels, as evaluated by biochemical analysis, compared with those \r\n      in both groups. Seventeen miRNAs were differentially expressed (DEMiRs) in the \r\n      plasma EVs of the three groups. DM patients showed upregulation of miR-141-3p and \r\n      downregulation of miR-324-5p and -376c-3p compared with the NG and GI groups. The \r\n      DM and GI groups showed increased miR-26b-5p expression compared with that in the \r\n      NG group. The DM group showed decreased miR-374b-5p levels compared with those in \r\n      the GI group and higher concentrations than those in the NG group. Thus, three EV \r\n      proteins and five DEMiR cargos have potential prognostic importance for diabetic \r\n      complications mainly associated with the immune function and iron status of GI \r\n      and DM patients.\r\nCI  - © 2021 The Authors.

Using a systems biology approach, we conducted \r\n      transcriptomic meta-analyses across in vitro models, liver tissues, and PBMCs \r\n      from hepatitis virus-infected patients to identify neuroimmune signatures. We \r\n      found a robust neuroimmunome signature, with neuroimmune-related genes showing \r\n      consistent differential expression across datasets. Functional enrichment \r\n      revealed disruptions in neurotransmission (including synaptic, glutamatergic, \r\n      noradrenergic and neuregulin pathways) and immune signaling (such as cytokines, \r\n      interleukin-1 response, T cell receptor, and trans-synaptic signaling). Linear \r\n      discriminant analysis (LDA) demonstrated that neuroimmune genes can predict \r\n      disease severity. Several of these genes were also altered in hepatocellular \r\n      carcinoma (HCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), implicating \r\n      them in oncogenic transformation. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed dysregulated \r\n      neuroimmune interactions in liver tissue, notably involving DBH-ADRA1A/B/D, \r\n      ADRA2A/B/C, ADRB1/2/3, IL33-IL1RL1, and NRG1-ERBB4. Critically, we observed an \r\n      inverse correlation between neuroimmune gene expression and inflammation markers \r\n      in advanced HCC, suggesting that neuroimmune suppression may facilitate immune \r\n      evasion. These findings highlight the neuroimmunome as a potential biomarker and \r\n      therapeutic target in hepatitis and its complications, reinforcing the role of \r\n      neuroimmune crosstalk in liver disease progression.\r\nCI  - © 2025 The Author(s).

We aimed to \r\n      identify transcriptomic immune response biomarker signatures induced by \r\n      vaccination and associated signatures with its immunogenicity and reactogenicity \r\n      to better understand the potential mechanisms of action of the vaccine. METHODS: \r\n      354 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated in randomised, double-blind, \r\n      placebo-controlled trials in Europe (Geneva, Switzerland [November, 2014, to \r\n      January, 2015]) and North America (USA [Dec 5, 2014, to June 23, 2015]), and \r\n      dose-escalation trials in Africa (Lambaréné, Gabon [November, 2014, to January, \r\n      2015], and Kilifi, Kenya [December, 2014, to January, 2015]) using different \r\n      doses of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the Zaire \r\n      Ebola virus glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP; 3 × 10(5) to 1 × 10(8) plaque-forming \r\n      units [pfu]). Longitudinal transcriptomic responses (days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and \r\n      28) were measured in whole blood using a targeted gene expression profiling \r\n      platform (dual-colour reverse-transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe \r\n      amplification) focusing on 144 immune-related genes. The effect of time and dose \r\n      on transcriptomic response was also assessed. Logistic regression with lasso \r\n      regularisation was applied to identify host signatures with optimal \r\n      discriminatory capability of vaccination at day 1 or day 7 versus baseline, \r\n      whereas random-effects models and recursive feature elimination combined with \r\n      regularised logistic regression were used to associate signatures with \r\n      immunogenicity and reactogenicity. FINDINGS: Our results indicated that \r\n      perturbation of gene expression peaked on day 1 and returned to baseline levels \r\n      between day 7 and day 28. The magnitude of the response was dose-dependent, with \r\n      vaccinees receiving a high dose (≥9 × 10(6) pfu) of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP exhibiting \r\n      the largest amplitude. The most differentially expressed genes that were \r\n      significantly upregulated following vaccination consisted of type I and II \r\n      interferon-related genes and myeloid cell-associated markers, whereas T cell, \r\n      natural killer cell, and cytotoxicity-associated genes were downregulated. A gene \r\n      signature associated with immunogenicity (common to all four cohorts) was \r\n      identified correlating gene expression profiles with ZEBOV-GP antibody titres and \r\n      a gene signatures associated with reactogenicity (Geneva cohort) was identified \r\n      correlating gene expression profiles with an adverse event (ie, arthritis). \r\n      INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our results identify and cross-validate \r\n      immune-related transcriptomic signatures induced by rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination \r\n      in four cohorts of adult participants from different genetic and geographical \r\n      backgrounds. These signatures will aid in the rational development, testing, and \r\n      evaluation of novel vaccines and will allow evaluation of the effect of host \r\n      factors such as age, co-infection, and comorbidity on responses to vaccines. \r\n      FUNDING: Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here we applied systems approaches to \r\n      investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza \r\n      vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy \r\n      children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers \r\n      following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, \r\n      multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses \r\n      to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants \r\n      were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen \r\n      presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, \r\n      transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. \r\n      Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response \r\n      (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with \r\n      hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the \r\n      magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to \r\n      vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and \r\n      identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Pathophysiology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \r\n      University of São Paulo, 05508, São Paulo, Brazil;

The RTS,S vaccination prevents Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) \r\n      malaria but is ineffective against Plasmodium vivax (Pv) disease. Herein, we \r\n      evaluated the murine immunogenicity of a recombinant PvCSP incorporating \r\n      prevalent polymorphisms, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or Poly I:C. Both \r\n      formulations induced prolonged IgG responses, with IgG1 dominance by the \r\n      Alhydrogel group and high titers of all IgG isotypes by the Poly I:C counterpart. \r\n      Poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccination increased splenic plasma cells, \r\n      terminally-differentiated memory cells (MBCs), and precursors relative to the \r\n      Alhydrogel-combined immunization.

To understand how these immune \r\n      responses are generated, we used a systems biological approach to analyze immune \r\n      responses to dengue in humans. Transcriptomic analysis of whole blood revealed \r\n      that genes encoding proinflammatory mediators and type I interferon-related \r\n      proteins were associated with high DENV levels during initial symptomatic \r\n      disease. Additionally, CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes increased in the blood. \r\n      Similarly, in a nonhuman primate model, DENV infection boosted CD14(+)CD16(+) \r\n      monocyte numbers in the blood and lymph nodes. Upon DENV infection in vitro, \r\n      monocytes upregulated CD16 and mediated differentiation of resting B cells to \r\n      plasmablasts as well as immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM secretion. These findings \r\n      provide a detailed picture of innate responses to dengue and highlight a role for \r\n      CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes in promoting plasmablast differentiation and anti-DENV \r\n      antibody responses.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Among the various \r\n      symptoms of DN, the development of chronic pain stands out and manifests as \r\n      exacerbated responses to sensorial stimuli. The conventional clinical treatments \r\n      used for general neuropathy and associated painful symptoms, still brings \r\n      uncomplete and unsatisfactory pain relief. Patients with neuropathic pain \r\n      syndromes are heterogeneous. They present with a variety of sensory symptoms and \r\n      pain qualities which difficult the correct diagnosis of sensory comorbidities and \r\n      consequently, the appropriate chronic pain management. AIMS: Herein, we aimed to \r\n      demonstrate the existence of different sensory profiles on diabetic patients by \r\n      investigating epidemiological and clinical data on the symptomatology of a group \r\n      of patients with DN. METHODS: This is a longitudinal and observational study, \r\n      with a sample of 57 volunteers diagnosed with diabetes from outpatient day clinic \r\n      of Hospital Universitário of the University of São Paulo-Brazil. After being \r\n      invited and signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF), patients were submitted to \r\n      clinical evaluation and filled out pain and quality of life questionnaires. They \r\n      also performed quantitative sensory test (QST) and underwent skin biopsy for \r\n      correlation with cutaneous neuropathology. RESULTS: Data demonstrate that 70% of \r\n      the studied sample presented some type of pain, manifesting in a neuropathic or \r\n      nociceptive way, what has a negative impact on the life of patients with DM. We \r\n      also demonstrated a positive association between pain and anxiety and depression, \r\n      in addition to pain catastrophic thoughts. Three distinct profiles were \r\n      identified in the sample, separated according to the symptoms of pain: (i) \r\n      subjects without pain; (ii) with mild or moderate pain; (iii) subjects with \r\n      severe pain. We also identified through skin biopsy that diabetic patients \r\n      presented advanced sensory impairment, as a consequence of the degeneration of \r\n      the myelinated and unmyelinated peripheral fibers. This study characterized the \r\n      painful symptoms and exteroceptive sensation profile in these diabetic patients, \r\n      associated to a considerable level of sensory degeneration, indicating, and \r\n      reinforcing the importance of the long-term clinical monitoring of individuals \r\n      diagnosed with DM, regarding their symptom profiles and exteroceptive \r\n      sensitivity.\r\nCI  - © 2024 World Institute of Pain.\r\nFAU - de Paula Oliveira, Inaeh\r\nAU  - de Paula Oliveira I\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1124-1921\r\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Silva Oliveira, Victória Regina\r\nAU  - da Silva Oliveira VR\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2620-7010\r\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Alonso-Matielo, Heloísa\r\nAU  - Alonso-Matielo H\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3616-4192\r\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Eng, Beatriz Magalhães\r\nAU  - Eng BM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2937-6795\r\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Andrade, Daniel Ciampi\r\nAU  - de Andrade DC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3411-632X\r\nAD  - Department of Health Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Aalborg \r\n      University, Aalborg, Denmark.\r\nFAU - Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen\r\nAU  - Teixeira MJ\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7974-6045\r\nAD  - Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Calsaverini, Milena Cristina Dias\r\nAU  - Calsaverini MCD\r\nAD  - Universitary Hospital, University of São Paulo Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Quadros Ribeiro, Fernando\r\nAU  - de Quadros Ribeiro F\r\nAD  - Universitary Hospital, University of São Paulo Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Araújo, José Deney Alves\r\nAU  - Araújo JDA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6239-3493\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Clinical Analysis & Toxicology, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder Takashi Imoto\r\nAU  - Nakaya HTI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Clinical Analysis & Toxicology, \r\n      University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Otoch, José Pinhata\r\nAU  - Otoch JP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8293-1508\r\nAD  - Department of Surgical Techniques, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Dale, Camila Squarzoni\r\nAU  - Dale CS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3421-7799\r\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Surgical Techniques, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, \r\n      São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/\r\nGR  - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico/\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Observational Study\r\nDEP - 20240213\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Pain Pract\r\nJT  - Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain\r\nJID - 101130835\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Middle Aged\r\nMH  - *Diabetic Neuropathies/physiopathology/diagnosis\r\nMH  - Longitudinal Studies\r\nMH  - Aged\r\nMH  - Pain Measurement/methods\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - Quality of Life\r\nMH  - Phenotype\r\nMH  - Neuralgia/physiopathology/diagnosis/etiology\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - chronic pain\r\nOT  - exteroceptive sensation\r\nOT  - intraepidermal nervous fiber\r\nOT  - peripheral diabetic neuropathy\r\nOT  - quantitative sensory test\r\nEDAT- 2024/02/13 06:45\r\nMHDA- 2024/06/14 06:43\r\nCRDT- 2024/02/13 04:45\r\nPHST- 2023/12/20 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2023/06/17 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2024/01/09 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2024/06/14 06:43 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2024/02/13 06:45 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2024/02/13 04:45 [entrez]\r\nAID - 10.1111/papr.13353 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Pain Pract. 2024 Jun;24(5):724-738. doi: 10.1111/papr.13353.

Although several studies have \r\n      attempted to identify JIA-related gene signatures, none have systematically \r\n      assessed the impact of sex on the whole blood transcriptomes of JIA patients. By \r\n      analyzing over 400 unique pediatric gene expression profiles, we characterized \r\n      the sexual differences in leukocyte composition of systemic JIA patients and \r\n      identified sex-specific gene signatures that were related to immature \r\n      neutrophils. Female systemic JIA patients presented higher activation of immature \r\n      neutrophil-related genes compared to males, and these genes were associated with \r\n      the response to IL-1 receptor blockade treatment. Also, we found that this \r\n      immature neutrophil signature is sexually dimorphic across human lifespan and in \r\n      adults with rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. These results suggest that \r\n      neutrophil maturation is sexually dimorphic in rheumatic inflammation, and that \r\n      this may impact disease progression and treatment.\r\nCI  - ©2020 Society for Leukocyte Biology.\r\nFAU - Prada-Medina, Cesar Augusto\r\nAU  - Prada-Medina CA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann\r\nAU  - Peron JPS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1638-8866\r\nAD  - Department of Immunology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-USP, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-USP, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20200813\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - J Leukoc Biol\r\nJT  - Journal of leukocyte biology\r\nJID - 8405628\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adolescent\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - Arthritis, Juvenile/*immunology/pathology\r\nMH  - Child\r\nMH  - *Databases, Nucleic Acid\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology\r\nMH  - *Sex Characteristics\r\nMH  - *Transcriptome\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - gene expression\r\nOT  - juvenile idiopathic arthritis\r\nOT  - meta-analysis\r\nOT  - neutrophil maturation\r\nOT  - sexual dimorphism\r\nEDAT- 2020/08/15 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/02/10 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2020/08/15 06:00\r\nPHST- 2020/01/30 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2020/07/08 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2020/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/02/10 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/08/15 06:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - 10.1002/JLB.6MA0720-015RR [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - J Leukoc Biol. 2020 Oct;108(4):1319-1327. doi: 10.1002/JLB.6MA0720-015RR.

Additionally, the diagnosis of patients is very poor due to the lack of \r\n      biomarkers than can detect the disease in early stages. Thus, it is of utmost \r\n      interest the generation of a multidisciplinary consortium from different \r\n      countries with a direct translation. The present reports the meeting of the 2021 \r\n      Iberoamerican Consortium for the study of liver Cirrhosis, held online, in \r\n      October 2021. The meeting, was focused on the recent advancements in the field of \r\n      chronic liver disease and cirrhosis with a specific focus on cell pathobiology \r\n      and liver regeneration, molecular and cellular targets involved in non-alcoholic \r\n      hepatic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), both ALD and western \r\n      diet, and end-stage liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, \r\n      the meeting highlighted recent advances in targeted novel technology (-omics) and \r\n      opening therapeutic avenues in this field of research.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

While their co-infection \r\n      has been well studied for Plasmodium falciparum, scarce data exist regarding the \r\n      association of P. vivax and HIV. In this cohort study, we assessed the effect of \r\n      HIV on the risk of vivax malaria infection and recurrence during a 4-year \r\n      follow-up period in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon. For the purpose of \r\n      this study, we obtained clinical information from January 2012 to December 2016 \r\n      from two databases. HIV screening data were acquired from the clinical \r\n      information system at the tropical hospital Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. \r\n      Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD). The National Malaria Surveillance database \r\n      (SIVEP malaria) was utilized to identify malaria infections during a 4-year \r\n      follow-up period after diagnosis of HIV. Both datasets were combined via data \r\n      linkage. Between 2012 and 2016, a total of 42,121 people were screened for HIV, \r\n      with 1569 testing positive (3.7%). Out of all the patients diagnosed with HIV, \r\n      198 had at least one episode of P. vivax malaria in the follow-up. In the \r\n      HIV-negative group, 711 participants had at least one P. vivax malaria episode. \r\n      When comparing both groups, HIV patients had a 6.48 [(5.37-7.83); P < 0.0001] \r\n      (adjusted relative risk) greater chance of acquiring P. vivax malaria. Moreover, \r\n      being of the male gender [ARR = 1.41 (1.17-1.71); P < 0.0001], Amerindian \r\n      ethnicity [ARR = 2.77 (1.46-5.28); P < 0.0001], and a resident in a municipality \r\n      of the Metropolitan region of Manaus [ARR = 1.48 (1.02-2.15); P = 0.038] were \r\n      independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of clinical malaria. \r\n      Education ≥ 8 years [ARR = 0.41 (0.26-0.64); P < 0.0001] and living in the urban \r\n      area [ARR = 0.44 (0.24-0.80); P = 0.007] were associated to a lower risk of P. \r\n      vivax malaria. A total of 28 (14.1%) and 180 (25.3%) recurrences (at least a \r\n      second clinical malaria episode) were reported in the HIV-positive and \r\n      HIV-negative groups, respectively. After adjusting for sex and education, \r\n      HIV-positive status was associated with a tendency towards protection from P. \r\n      vivax malaria recurrences [ARR = 0.55 (0.27-1.10); P = 0.090]. HIV status was not \r\n      associated with hospitalizations due to P. vivax malaria. CD4 + counts and viral \r\n      load were not associated with recurrences of P. vivax malaria. No significant \r\n      differences were found in the distribution of parasitemia between HIV-negative \r\n      and HIV-positive P. vivax malaria patients. Our results suggest that HIV-positive \r\n      status is a risk factor for vivax malaria infection, which represents an \r\n      additional challenge that should be addressed during elimination efforts.\r\nCI  - © 2022.

Despite its clinical significance, the \r\n      specific cellular and molecular mechanisms driving PNI in PDAC remain poorly \r\n      defined. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data from approximately 60,000 \r\n      single cells across 24 PDAC biopsy specimens to characterize the cellular \r\n      composition and signaling networks associated with PNI. We found that pancreatic \r\n      stellate cells (PSCs) expressing high levels of Periostin (POSTN), collagens, and \r\n      metalloproteinases are enriched in PNI-positive samples, suggesting an active \r\n      role in extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion. Spatial \r\n      transcriptomics revealed that these POSTN + PSCs are located adjacent to tumor \r\n      cells in invasive regions but are more distant in non-invasive samples. Invasive \r\n      tumors show a coordinated expression pattern involving ANXA1 in tumor cells, SPP1 \r\n      and PLAU in PSCs, and their receptors in myeloid cells, supporting a signaling \r\n      axis that promotes perineural invasion.

Vaccination induced genes that regulate virus innate sensing and type I \r\n      interferon production. Computational analyses identified a gene signature, \r\n      including complement protein C1qB and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 \r\n      alpha kinase 4-an orchestrator of the integrated stress response-that correlated \r\n      with and predicted YF-17D CD8(+) T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an \r\n      independent, blinded trial. A distinct signature, including B cell growth factor \r\n      TNFRS17, predicted the neutralizing antibody response with up to 100% accuracy. \r\n      These data highlight the utility of systems biology approaches in predicting \r\n      vaccine efficacy.\r\nFAU -

We examined changes in the oral and gut microbiota in a \r\n      mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) treated or not with methotrexate \r\n      (MTX). METHODS: Maxillae and stools were evaluated by the MiSeq platform of the \r\n      V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Alveolar bone parameters were analysed by \r\n      micro-computed tomography. Moreover, arthritis-induced changes in hyperalgesia \r\n      and oedema were assessed, along with the impact on periodontal bone health. \r\n      RESULTS: Microbial communities in MTX-treated AIA mice revealed distinct clusters \r\n      compared to the control and AIA groups. Overall, MTX impacted the richness and \r\n      variability of microorganisms in the oral-gut axis microbiome at the phylum \r\n      level. Regarding the oral microbiome, while in the control group the most \r\n      dominant phylum was Firmicutes, in the AIA group there was a shift towards the \r\n      predominance of Campilobacteriota and Bacteroidetes associated with the disease. \r\n      MTX treatment led to greater dominance of the health-associated phylum \r\n      Proteobacteria. In the gut microbiome, AIA induction resulted in increased \r\n      abundance of the Verrucomicrobiota phylum, and MTX treatment restored its levels \r\n      compared to control. Importantly, the MTX-treated AIA animals had significantly \r\n      less periodontal bone loss, as well as decreased hyperalgesia and joint oedema \r\n      compared to the AIA animals.

Analytical and machine learning models have been applied to \r\n      facilitate the process of antigenicity determination. In this study, we designed \r\n      deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict Influenza antigenicity. Our \r\n      model is the first that systematically analyzed 566 amino acid properties and 141 \r\n      amino acid substitution matrices for their predictability. We then optimized the \r\n      structure of the CNNs using particle swarm optimization. The optimal neural \r\n      networks outperform other predictive models with a blind validation accuracy of \r\n      95.8%. Further, we applied our model to vaccine recommendations in the period \r\n      1997 to 2011 and contrasted the performance of previous vaccine recommendations \r\n      using traditional experimental approaches. The results show that our model \r\n      outperforms the WHO recommendation and other existing models and could \r\n      potentially improve the vaccine recommendation process. Our results show that WHO \r\n      often selects virus strains with small variation from year to year and learns \r\n      slowly and recovers once coverage dips very low. In contrast, the influenza \r\n      strains selected via our CNN model can differ quite drastically from year to year \r\n      and exhibit consistently good coverage. In summary, we have designed a \r\n      comprehensive computational pipeline for optimizing a CNN in the modeling of \r\n      Influenza A antigenicity and vaccine recommendation. It is more cost and \r\n      time-effective when compared to traditional hemagglutination inhibition assay \r\n      analysis. The modeling framework is flexible and can be adopted to study other \r\n      type of viruses.\r\nFAU - Lee, Eva K\r\nAU  - Lee EK\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0415-4640\r\nAD  - Center for Operations Research in Medicine and Healthcare, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology , Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nAD  - Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology , Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nAD  - School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta, GA, \r\n      USA.\r\nAD  - School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology , \r\n      Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nFAU - Tian, Haozheng\r\nAU  - Tian H\r\nAD  - Center for Operations Research in Medicine and Healthcare, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology , Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nAD  - Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology , Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nAD  - School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta, GA, \r\n      USA.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.\r\nDEP - 20200804\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Hum Vaccin Immunother\r\nJT  - Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics\r\nJID - 101572652\r\nRN  - 0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)\r\nRN  - 0 (Influenza Vaccines)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests\r\nMH  - Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype\r\nMH  - *Influenza Vaccines\r\nMH  - *Influenza, Human/prevention & control\r\nMH  - Neural Networks, Computer\r\nPMC - PMC7734114\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Convolution neural networks\r\nOT  - H3N2\r\nOT  - Influenza A\r\nOT  - antigenicity\r\nOT  - deep learning\r\nOT  - flu vaccine strain selection\r\nOT  - machine learning\r\nOT  - particle swarm optimization\r\nEDAT- 2020/08/05 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/06/22 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2020/08/04\r\nCRDT- 2020/08/05 06:00\r\nPHST- 2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2020/08/04 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 1734397 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1080/21645515.2020.1734397 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2020 Nov 1;16(11):2690-2708. doi: \r\n      10.1080/21645515.2020.1734397.

We revisited the data generated by The \r\n      Brazilian Multicenter Study on Operational Tolerance involving different \r\n      conceptual fields - antigen-specific cytokine response, immune cell numbers and \r\n      repertoire, signaling pathways, and epigenetics. We integrated our data to pave \r\n      the way to systems biology thinking and harness debate on potential mechanisms in \r\n      OT. We present original data on systems biology in OT, connecting potential \r\n      mechanistic players. Using bioinformatics, we identified three dominant features \r\n      that discriminate OT from its opposing clinical outcome, chronic rejection (CR). \r\n      The OT-CR discriminative molecules were FOXP3, GATA3 and STAT6, each \r\n      corresponding to a differential profile: (1) In FOXP3, OT presents preserved \r\n      regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers but decreased numbers in CR; (2) in GATA3, \r\n      increased expression is seen in OT; and (3) in STAT6, decreased monocyte \r\n      activation is seen in OT. With these variables, we built molecular networks to \r\n      identify interactions related to OT versus CR. Our first systems biology endeavor \r\n      gave rise to novel potentially relevant interconnected players in OT mechanisms: \r\n      FOXP3 connecting to interleukin-9 (IL-9) and IL-35 signaling, suggesting their \r\n      immunoregulatory involvement in OT. Likewise, GATA3/FOXP3 interactions \r\n      incrementing/stabilizing FOXP3 transcription suggest participation in keeping \r\n      healthy FOXP3+ Tregs in OT. We envision that systems biology thinking will \r\n      greatly contribute to advancing knowledge in human transplantation tolerance in \r\n      an interactive perspective.\r\nFAU - Coelho, Verônica\r\nAU  - Coelho V\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Imunologia, Instituto do Coração (InCor), Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, São Paulo, SP, Brasil;

Furthermore, ablation of beta-catenin expression in DCs \r\n      enhanced inflammatory responses and disease in a mouse model of inflammatory \r\n      bowel disease.

Systems biology \r\n      approaches have been used to determine signatures that can be used to predict \r\n      vaccine-induced immunity in humans, but whether there is a 'universal signature' \r\n      that can be used to predict antibody responses to any vaccine is unknown. Here we \r\n      did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate \r\n      vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of \r\n      published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To \r\n      achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available \r\n      human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological \r\n      contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules \r\n      revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different \r\n      classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein \r\n      recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early \r\n      transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and \r\n      demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.\r\nFAU - Li, Shuzhao\r\nAU  - Li S\r\nAD  - 1] Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

Due to the high cost of developing novel drugs, drug repositioning \r\n      represents a promising alternative method of treatment. In this manuscript, we \r\n      used a network medicine approach to investigate the molecular characteristics of \r\n      PNDs and identify novel drug candidates for repositioning. Using IBM Watson for \r\n      Drug Discovery, a powerful machine learning text-mining application, we built \r\n      knowledge networks containing connections between PNDs and genes or drugs \r\n      mentioned in the scientific literature published in the past 50 years. This \r\n      approach revealed several drugs that target key PND-related genes, which have \r\n      never been used to treat these disorders to date. We validate our framework by \r\n      detecting drugs that have been undergoing clinical trial for treating some of the \r\n      PNDs, but have no published results in their support. Our data provides \r\n      comprehensive insights into the molecular pathology of PNDs and offers promising \r\n      drug repositioning candidates for follow-up trials.\r\nFAU - Lüscher Dias, Thomaz\r\nAU  - Lüscher Dias T\r\nAD  - Departament of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, \r\n      Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Schuch, Viviane\r\nAU  - Schuch V\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Beltrão-Braga, Patrícia Cristina Baleeiro\r\nAU  - Beltrão-Braga PCB\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur USP, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martins-de-Souza, Daniel\r\nAU  - Martins-de-Souza D\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3595-5846\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Neuroproteomics, Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, \r\n      Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Instituto Nacional de Biomarcadores em Neuropsiquiatria, Conselho Nacional de \r\n      Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Experimental Medicine Research Cluster (EMRC), University of Campinas, Campinas, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nAD  - D'Or Institute of Reasearch and Education (IDOR), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Brentani, Helena Paula\r\nAU  - Brentani HP\r\nAD  - Instituto de Psiquiatria, Hospital das Clínicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, \r\n      Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - National Institute of Developmental Psychiatry for Children and Adolescents \r\n      (INPD), São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Franco, Glória Regina\r\nAU  - Franco GR\r\nAD  - Departament of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, \r\n      Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder Imoto\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. hnakaya@usp.br.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur USP, São Paulo, Brazil. hnakaya@usp.br.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 001/Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (Brazilian \r\n      Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate \r\n      Education)/International\r\nGR  - 2018/16748-8/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo \r\n      Research Foundation)/International\r\nGR  - 2017/25588-1/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo \r\n      Research Foundation)/International\r\nGR  - 2014/10068-4/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo \r\n      Research Foundation)/International\r\nGR  - 2018/03673-0/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo \r\n      Research Foundation)/International\r\nGR  - 2019/00098-7/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo \r\n      Research Foundation)/International\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20200512\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Transl Psychiatry\r\nJT  - Translational psychiatry\r\nJID - 101562664\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Computational Biology\r\nMH  - Data Mining\r\nMH  - *Drug Repositioning\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Machine Learning\r\nMH  - *Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy\r\nPMC - PMC7217930\r\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2020/05/14 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/06/22 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2020/05/12\r\nCRDT- 2020/05/14 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/10/30 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2020/04/09 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2020/03/19 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/12 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41398-020-0827-5 [pii]\r\nAID - 827 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1038/s41398-020-0827-5 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Transl Psychiatry. 2020 May 12;10(1):141. doi: 10.1038/s41398-020-0827-5.\r\n\r\nPMID- 26402251\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20160328\r\nLR  - 20181113\r\nIS  - 1935-2735 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1935-2727 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1935-2727 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 9\r\nIP  - 9\r\nDP  - 2015\r\nTI  - Synergy of Omeprazole and Praziquantel In Vitro Treatment against Schistosoma \r\n      mansoni Adult Worms.\r\nPG  - e0004086\r\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004086 [doi]\r\nLID - e0004086\r\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis relies on a single \r\n      drug, praziquantel (PZQ), and the selection of resistant worms under repeated \r\n      treatment is a concern. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the \r\n      molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or \r\n      synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. METHODOLOGY: We used a custom-designed \r\n      Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal \r\n      doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and \r\n      unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) \r\n      or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro \r\n      assay. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ \r\n      in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression \r\n      patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), \r\n      indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also \r\n      identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. \r\n      Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite \r\n      genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for \r\n      proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different \r\n      drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed \r\n      proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and \r\n      tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm \r\n      mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a \r\n      synergistic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Functional analysis of gene interaction networks \r\n      is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug \r\n      candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in \r\n      combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult \r\n      worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone.\r\nFAU - Almeida, Giulliana T\r\nAU  - Almeida GT\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lage, Regina C G\r\nAU  - Lage RC\r\nAD  - Genomics and Computational Biology Group, Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou - \r\n      FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Anderson, Leticia\r\nAU  - Anderson L\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Venancio, Thiago M\r\nAU  - Venancio TM\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Miyasato, Patrícia A\r\nAU  - Miyasato PA\r\nAD  - Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Rofatto, Henrique K\r\nAU  - Rofatto HK\r\nAD  - Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Zerlotini, Adhemar\r\nAU  - Zerlotini A\r\nAD  - Genomics and Computational Biology Group, Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou - \r\n      FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakano, Eliana\r\nAU  - Nakano E\r\nAD  - Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Guilherme\r\nAU  - Oliveira G\r\nAD  - Genomics and Computational Biology Group, Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou - \r\n      FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil; Vale Technology Institute, Belém, \r\n      Pará, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil; Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GEO/GPL8606\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE66697\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20150924\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PLoS Negl Trop Dis\r\nJT  - PLoS neglected tropical diseases\r\nJID - 101291488\r\nRN  - 0 (Anthelmintics)\r\nRN  - 0 (DNA, Helminth)\r\nRN  - 6490C9U457 (Praziquantel)\r\nRN  - KG60484QX9 (Omeprazole)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Anthelmintics/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - DNA, Helminth/chemistry/genetics\r\nMH  - *Drug Synergism\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Microarray Analysis\r\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\r\nMH  - Omeprazole/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - Praziquantel/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - Schistosoma mansoni/*drug effects/physiology\r\nMH  - Sequence Analysis, DNA\r\nMH  - Survival Analysis\r\nPMC - PMC4581627\r\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\r\nEDAT- 2015/09/25 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2016/03/29 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2015/09/24\r\nCRDT- 2015/09/25 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/03/17 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2015/08/25 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2015/09/25 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2015/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2015/09/24 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - PNTD-D-15-00436 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004086 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Sep 24;9(9):e0004086. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004086. \r\n      eCollection 2015.\r\n\r\nPMID- 26086673\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20160308\r\nLR  - 20201217\r\nIS  - 1935-2735 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1935-2727 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1935-2727 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 9\r\nIP  - 6\r\nDP  - 2015\r\nTI  - MicroRNA Transcriptome Profiling in Heart of Trypanosoma cruzi-Infected Mice: \r\n      Parasitological and Cardiological Outcomes.\r\nPG  - e0003828\r\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003828 [doi]\r\nLID - e0003828\r\nAB  - Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it begins with a \r\n      short acute phase characterized by high parasitemia followed by a life-long \r\n      chronic phase with scarce parasitism. Cardiac involvement is the most prominent \r\n      manifestation, as 30% of infected subjects will develop abnormal ventricular \r\n      repolarization with myocarditis, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by \r\n      undefined mechanisms. Nevertheless, follow-up studies in chagasic patients, as \r\n      well as studies with murine models, suggest that the intensity of clinical \r\n      symptoms and pathophysiological events that occur during the acute phase of \r\n      disease are associated with the severity of cardiac disease observed during the \r\n      chronic phase. In the present study we investigated the role of microRNAs \r\n      (miRNAs) in the disease progression in response to T. cruzi infection, as \r\n      alterations in miRNA levels are known to be associated with many cardiovascular \r\n      disorders. We screened 641 rodent miRNAs in heart samples of mice during an acute \r\n      infection with the Colombiana T.cruzi strain and identified multiple miRNAs \r\n      significantly altered upon infection. Seventeen miRNAs were found significantly \r\n      deregulated in all three analyzed time points post infection. Among these, six \r\n      miRNAs had their expression correlated with clinical parameters relevant to the \r\n      disease, such as parasitemia and maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. \r\n      Computational analyses identified that the gene targets for these six miRNAs were \r\n      involved in networks and signaling pathways related to increased ventricular \r\n      depolarization and repolarization times, important factors for QTc interval \r\n      prolongation. The data presented here will guide further studies about the \r\n      contribution of microRNAs to Chagas heart disease pathogenesis.\r\nFAU - Navarro, Isabela Cunha\r\nAU  - Navarro IC\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Immunology, Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo School \r\n      of Medicine, São Paulo, Brazil;

However, little is known about the \r\n      molecular differences between individuals having each profile. Here, we performed \r\n      whole-blood transcriptomic analyses of 56 infected individuals from Pará State \r\n      (Brazilian Amazon), covering all five profiles. We then identified the gene \r\n      signatures of each profile by comparing their transcriptome with those of 11 \r\n      healthy individuals from the same area. Symptomatic individuals with SI (=AVL) \r\n      and SOI profiles showed higher transcriptome perturbation when compared to those \r\n      asymptomatic III, AI and SRI profiles, suggesting that disease severity may be \r\n      associated with greater transcriptomic changes. Although the expression of many \r\n      genes was altered on each profile, very few genes were shared among the profiles. \r\n      This indicated that each profile has a unique gene signature. The innate immune \r\n      system pathway was strongly activated only in asymptomatic AI and SRI profiles, \r\n      suggesting the control of infection. In turn, pathways such as MHC Class II \r\n      antigen presentation and NF-kB activation in B cells seemed to be specifically \r\n      induced in symptomatic SI (=AVL) and SOI profiles. Moreover, cellular response to \r\n      starvation was down-regulated in those symptomatic profiles. Overall, this study \r\n      revealed five distinct transcriptional patterns associated to the \r\n      clinical-immunological (symptomatic and asymptomatic) profiles of human L. (L.) \r\n      chagasi-infection in the Brazilian Amazon.\r\nFAU - da Matta, Vania Lucia R\r\nAU  - da Matta VLR\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3509-6121\r\nAD  - Laboratorio de Patologia de Molestias Infecciosas (LIM-50), Departamento de \r\n      Patologia, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246 903, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU -

ASCs (plasmablasts) have \r\n      been extensively studied in humans, but less is known about B cells that become \r\n      activated but do not differentiate into plasmablasts. Here we have defined the \r\n      phenotype and transcriptional program of a subset of antigen-specific B cells, \r\n      which we have called 'activated B cells' (ABCs), that were distinct from ASCs and \r\n      were committed to the MBC lineage. We detected ABCs in humans after infection \r\n      with Ebola virus or influenza virus and also after vaccination. By simultaneously \r\n      analyzing antigen-specific ASCs and ABCs in human blood after vaccination against \r\n      influenza virus, we investigated the clonal overlap and extent of somatic \r\n      hypermutation (SHM) in the ASC (effector) and ABC (memory) lineages. Longitudinal \r\n      tracking of vaccination-induced hemagglutinin (HA)-specific clones revealed no \r\n      overall increase in SHM over time, which suggested that repeated annual \r\n      immunization might have limitations in enhancing the quality of \r\n      influenza-virus-specific antibody.\r\nFAU -

Herein we highlight \r\n      the propensity of CHIKV infections to persist long term, both as persistent, \r\n      steady-state, viraemias in multiple B cell deficient mouse strains, and as \r\n      persistent RNA (including negative-strand RNA) in wild-type mice. The knockout \r\n      mouse studies provided evidence for a role for T cells (but not NK cells) in \r\n      viraemia suppression, and confirmed the role of T cells in arthritis promotion, \r\n      with vaccine-induced T cells also shown to be arthritogenic in the absence of \r\n      antibody responses. However, MHC class II-restricted T cells were not required \r\n      for production of anti-viral IgG2c responses post CHIKV infection. The anti-viral \r\n      cytokines, TNF and IFNγ, were persistently elevated in persistently infected B \r\n      and T cell deficient mice, with adoptive transfer of anti-CHIKV antibodies unable \r\n      to clear permanently the viraemia from these, or B cell deficient, mice. The NOD \r\n      background increased viraemia and promoted arthritis, with B, T and NK deficient \r\n      NOD mice showing high-levels of persistent viraemia and ultimately succumbing to \r\n      encephalitic disease. In wild-type mice persistent CHIKV RNA and negative strand \r\n      RNA (detected for up to 100 days post infection) was associated with persistence \r\n      of cellular infiltrates, CHIKV antigen and stimulation of IFNα/β and T cell \r\n      responses. These studies highlight that, secondary to antibodies, several factors \r\n      are involved in virus control, and suggest that chronic arthritic disease is a \r\n      consequence of persistent, replicating and transcriptionally active CHIKV RNA.\r\nFAU -

These data were \r\n      integrated with DNA binding in vivo of LexA1, a regulator of the DNA damage \r\n      response, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel DNA \r\n      sequencing (ChIP-seq). In response to DNA damage, Leptospira induced expression \r\n      of genes involved in DNA metabolism, in mobile genetic elements and defective \r\n      prophages. The DNA repair genes involved in removal of photo-damage (e.g. \r\n      nucleotide excision repair uvrABC, recombinases recBCD and resolvases ruvABC) \r\n      were not induced. Genes involved in various metabolic pathways were down \r\n      regulated, including genes involved in cell growth, RNA metabolism and the \r\n      tricarboxylic acid cycle. From ChIP-seq data, we observed 24 LexA1 binding sites \r\n      located throughout chromosome 1 and one binding site in chromosome 2. Expression \r\n      of many, but not all, genes near those sites was increased following DNA damage. \r\n      Binding sites were found as far as 550 bp upstream from the start codon, or 1 kb \r\n      into the coding sequence. Our findings indicate that there is a shift in gene \r\n      expression following DNA damage that represses genes involved in cell growth and \r\n      virulence, and induces genes involved in mutagenesis and recombination.\r\nCI  - © The Author(s) 2016.

We \r\n      use trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate challenge \r\n      model in children aged 24-59 months to identify pre-infection mucosal \r\n      transcriptomic signatures associated with subsequent viral shedding. Upregulation \r\n      of interferon signaling pathways prior to LAIV is significantly associated with \r\n      lower strain-specific viral loads (VLs) at days 2 and 7. Several \r\n      interferon-stimulated genes are differentially expressed in children with \r\n      pre-LAIV asymptomatic respiratory viral infections and negatively correlated with \r\n      LAIV VLs. Upregulation of genes enriched in macrophages, neutrophils, and \r\n      eosinophils is associated with lower VLs and found more commonly in children with \r\n      asymptomatic viral infections. Variability in pre-infection mucosal interferon \r\n      gene expression in children may impact the course of subsequent influenza \r\n      infections. This variability may be due to frequent respiratory viral infections, \r\n      demonstrating the potential importance of mucosal virus-virus interactions in \r\n      children.\r\nCI  - © 2021 The Author(s).\r\nFAU - Costa-Martins, André G\r\nAU  - Costa-Martins AG\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Mane, Karim\r\nAU  - Mane K\r\nAD  - Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and \r\n      Tropical Medicine, P.O.

We report \r\n      seropositivity rates, geometric mean titres (GMTs), and population distribution \r\n      of ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus and \r\n      live-virus neutralization) and antibody avidity; the primary outcome was ZEBOV-GP \r\n      ELISA IgG GMTs at 4 or 5 years compared with 1 year (Y1) after immunization. \r\n      RESULTS: Among the 168 eligible vaccinees (Geneva: 97 and Lambaréné: 71) enrolled \r\n      1 year post-immunization, 146 (87%) remained enrolled at 4 years (Geneva: n = 88, \r\n      Lambaréné: n = 58), and 84 (87%, Geneva) at 5 years post-vaccination. ZEBOV-GP \r\n      ELISA IgG GMTs plateaued, with no declining trend from 1 year through the last \r\n      time point assessed (1147.8 [95% CI 874.3-1507.0] at Y1 versus 1548.1 [95% CI \r\n      1136.6-2108.5] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers receiving ≥10 million plaque-forming \r\n      units of rVSV-ZEBOV), their avidity matching that of ZEBOV convalescents. \r\n      Live-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected for shorter periods and in fewer \r\n      vaccinees (53/95 [56%] at Y1 versus 35/84 [42%] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers, all \r\n      dose levels). DISCUSSION: Titres at Y1 emerged as a correlate of antibody \r\n      persistence at Y5. The findings of persistent ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG titres yet \r\n      shorter-lasting, lower titres of live-virus neutralizing antibodies suggest the \r\n      contribution of antibody-mediated protective mechanisms other than \r\n      neutralization. Long-term clinical efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV, however, requires \r\n      further study.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2023 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious \r\n      Diseases.

However, \r\n      low-grade and transient viremia limits the prompt diagnosis of acute ZIKV \r\n      infection. We have investigated the plasma cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor \r\n      profiles of 36 individuals from an endemic area displaying different symptoms \r\n      such as exanthema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, hyperemia, swelling, \r\n      itching, and nausea during early-phase infection. These profiles were then \r\n      associated with symptoms, revealing important aspects of the \r\n      immunopathophysiology of ZIKV infection. The levels of some cytokines/chemokines \r\n      were significantly higher in acute ZIKV-infected individuals compared to healthy \r\n      donors, including interferon (IFN) gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), regulated on \r\n      activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-γ, interleukin \r\n      (IL)-9, IL-7, IL-5, and IL-1ra, including some with predominantly \r\n      immunoregulatory activity. Of note, we found that higher levels of IP-10 and IL-5 \r\n      in ZIKV-infected individuals were strongly associated with exanthema and \r\n      headache, respectively. Also, higher levels of IL-1ra were associated with \r\n      subjects with arthralgia, whereas those with fever showed lower levels of \r\n      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). No correlation was observed \r\n      between the number of symptoms and ZIKV viral load. Interestingly, only IP-10 \r\n      showed significantly decreased levels in the recovery phase. In conclusion, our \r\n      results indicate that acute ZIKV infection in a larger cohort resident to an \r\n      endemic area displays a modest systemic immune activation profile, involving both \r\n      proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines that could \r\n      participate of virus control. In addition, we showed that differential \r\n      cytokine/chemokine levels are related to specific clinical symptoms, suggesting \r\n      their participation in underlying mechanisms.\r\nFAU - Barros, Jéssica Barletto de Sousa\r\nAU  -

One of the manifestations is an atypical \r\n      non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of \r\n      Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of \r\n      cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from \r\n      Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation \r\n      of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in \r\n      NUCL involved in CD8(+) T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species \r\n      generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement \r\n      receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL \r\n      by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T \r\n      lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and \r\n      down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated \r\n      DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, \r\n      down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome \r\n      findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin \r\n      lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS \r\n      and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the \r\n      benign nature of the NUCL.\r\nFAU - Batista, Luís Fábio S\r\nAU  - Batista LFS\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sandoval Pacheco, Carmen M\r\nAU  - Sandoval Pacheco CM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6566-4869\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Flores, Gabriela V Araujo\r\nAU  - Flores GVA\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Frederico M\r\nAU  - Ferreira FM\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, André N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, University of São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sosa-Ochoa, Wilfredo H\r\nAU  - Sosa-Ochoa WH\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1387-7488\r\nAD  - Microbiology Research Institute, National Autonomous University of Honduras, \r\n      Tegucigalpa 11101, Honduras.\r\nFAU - da Matta, Vânia L R\r\nAU  - da Matta VLR\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3509-6121\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gomes, Claudia M C\r\nAU  - Gomes CMC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-9909-9466\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Zúniga, Concepción\r\nAU  - Zúniga C\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2622-792X\r\nAD  - Department of Health Surveillance, National Autonomous University of Honduras, \r\n      Tegucigalpa 05005, Honduras.\r\nFAU - Corbett, Carlos E P\r\nAU  - Corbett CEP\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Jeffares, Daniel C\r\nAU  - Jeffares DC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7320-0706\r\nAD  - Department of Biology, York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York, \r\n      York YO31 5DD, UK.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, University of São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo 05620, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silveira, Fernando T\r\nAU  - Silveira FT\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0412-6060\r\nAD  - Evandro Chagas Institute, Belém 66093-020, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Laurenti, Márcia D\r\nAU  - Laurenti MD\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1080-2440\r\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo \r\n      01246-903, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 2014/50315-0, 2020/10430-6, 2022/16578-0/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado \r\n      de São Paulo/\r\nGR  - HC-FMUSP/Laboratorio de Patologia de Moléstias Infecciosas (LIM50)/\r\nGR  - 308817/2021-4/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico \r\n      (CNPq)/\r\nGR  - UK: Brazil Joint Centre Partnership in Leishmaniasis (MR/S019472/1)/MRC_/Medical \r\n      Research Council/United Kingdom\r\nGR  - MRC New Investigator Research Grant (MR/T016019/1)/MRC_/Medical Research \r\n      Council/United Kingdom\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20250213\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Microorganisms\r\nJT  - Microorganisms\r\nJID - 101625893\r\nPMC - PMC11858551\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - L.

We show here that the \r\n      complement of ncRNAs expressed from intronic regions of the human and mouse \r\n      genomes comprises at least 78,147 and 39,660 transcriptional units, respectively. \r\n      To identify conserved intronic sequences expressed in both humans and mice, we \r\n      used custom-designed human cDNA microarrays to separately interrogate RNA from \r\n      mouse and human liver, kidney, and prostate tissues. An overlapping tissue \r\n      expression signature was detected for both species, comprising 198 transcripts; \r\n      among these, 22 RNAs map to intronic regions with evidence of evolutionary \r\n      conservation in humans and mice. Transcription of selected human-mouse intronic \r\n      ncRNAs was confirmed using strand-specific RT-PCR. Altogether, these results \r\n      support an evolutionarily conserved role of intronic ncRNAs in human and mouse, \r\n      which are likely to be involved in the fine tuning of gene expression regulation \r\n      in different mammalian tissues.\r\nFAU - Louro, Rodrigo\r\nAU  - Louro R\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      05508-900 São Paulo, Brasil.\r\nFAU - El-Jundi, Tarik\r\nAU  - El-Jundi T\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20080521\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Genomics\r\nJT  - Genomics\r\nJID - 8800135\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Untranslated)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Base Sequence\r\nMH  - *Evolution, Molecular\r\nMH  - Expressed Sequence Tags\r\nMH  - *Gene Expression Regulation\r\nMH  - Genome\r\nMH  - Genome, Human\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Introns/genetics/*physiology\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nMH  - RNA, Untranslated/genetics/*physiology\r\nMH  - *Transcription, Genetic\r\nEDAT- 2008/05/23 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2008/07/08 09:00\r\nCRDT- 2008/05/23 09:00\r\nPHST- 2008/01/04 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2008/03/25 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2008/03/28 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - S0888-7543(08)00082-7 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1016/j.ygeno.2008.03.013 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Genomics. 2008 Jul;92(1):18-25. doi: 10.1016/j.ygeno.2008.03.013.

The \r\n      underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we addressed this question in a mouse \r\n      model of Plasmodium chabaudi infection. Inflammatory gene expression and \r\n      carbohydrate metabolism are both enhanced in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-primed \r\n      leukocytes and liver cells from P. chabaudi-infected mice. Tumor necrosis factor \r\n      α (TNFα) expression oscillates across the host circadian cycle, and increased \r\n      TNFα correlates with hypoglycemia and a higher frequency of non-replicative ring \r\n      forms of trophozoites. Conversely, parasites proliferate and acquire biomass \r\n      during food intake by the host. Importantly, cyclic hypoglycemia is attenuated \r\n      and synchronization of P. chabaudi stages is disrupted in IFNγ(-/-), TNF \r\n      receptor(-/-), or diabetic mice. Hence, the daily rhythm of systemic TNFα \r\n      production and host food intake set the pace for Plasmodium synchronization with \r\n      the host's circadian cycle.

The mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear, but emerging \r\n      evidence indicates that they activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors \r\n      (TLRs). For example, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful \r\n      empiric vaccines ever developed, activates dendritic cells via multiple TLRs to \r\n      stimulate proinflammatory cytokines. Triggering specific combinations of TLRs in \r\n      dendritic cells can induce synergistic production of cytokines, which results in \r\n      enhanced T-cell responses, but its impact on antibody responses remain unknown. \r\n      Learning the critical parameters of innate immunity that program such antibody \r\n      responses remains a major challenge in vaccinology. Here we demonstrate that \r\n      immunization of mice with synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus \r\n      ligands that signal through TLR4 and TLR7 induces synergistic increases in \r\n      antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with \r\n      nanoparticles containing antigens plus a single TLR ligand. Consistent with this \r\n      there was enhanced persistence of germinal centres and of plasma-cell responses, \r\n      which persisted in the lymph nodes for >1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no \r\n      enhancement of the early short-lived plasma-cell response relative to that \r\n      observed with single TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells, \r\n      isolated 7 days after immunization, indicated that there was early programming \r\n      towards B-cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of \r\n      both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells, as well as on T-cell help. Immunization \r\n      protected completely against lethal avian and swine influenza virus strains in \r\n      mice, and induced robust immunity against pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus \r\n      macaques.\r\nFAU - Kasturi, Sudhir Pai\r\nAU  - Kasturi SP\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Skountzou, Ioanna\r\nAU  - Skountzou I\r\nFAU - Albrecht, Randy A\r\nAU  - Albrecht RA\r\nFAU - Koutsonanos, Dimitrios\r\nAU  - Koutsonanos D\r\nFAU - Hua, Tang\r\nAU  - Hua T\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Ravindran, Rajesh\r\nAU  - Ravindran R\r\nFAU - Stewart, Shelley\r\nAU  - Stewart S\r\nFAU - Alam, Munir\r\nAU  - Alam M\r\nFAU - Kwissa, Marcin\r\nAU  - Kwissa M\r\nFAU - Villinger, Francois\r\nAU  - Villinger F\r\nFAU - Murthy, Niren\r\nAU  - Murthy N\r\nFAU - Steel, John\r\nAU  - Steel J\r\nFAU - Jacob, Joshy\r\nAU  - Jacob J\r\nFAU - Hogan, Robert J\r\nAU  - Hogan RJ\r\nFAU - García-Sastre, Adolfo\r\nAU  - García-Sastre A\r\nFAU - Compans, Richard\r\nAU  - Compans R\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE25677\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U01 AI070469/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U01AI070469/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R56 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37AI48638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01 AI050025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54AI57158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01 AI50025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54 AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Nature\r\nJT  - Nature\r\nJID - 0410462\r\nRN  - 0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)\r\nRN  - 0 (Antibodies, Viral)\r\nRN  - 0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)\r\nRN  - 0 (Influenza Vaccines)\r\nRN  - 0 (Ligands)\r\nRN  - 0 (Toll-Like Receptors)\r\nRN  - 1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)\r\nRN  - 26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)\r\nRN  - 33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nCIN - Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2011 Apr;10(4):258. doi: 10.1038/nrd3426.

How P. \r\n      vivax infection can lead to poor clinical outcomes, despite low peripheral \r\n      parasitaemia, remains a matter of intense debate. Estimation of total P. vivax \r\n      biomass based on circulating markers indicates existence of a predominant \r\n      parasite population outside of circulation. In this study, we investigate \r\n      associations between both peripheral and total parasite biomass and host response \r\n      in vivax malaria. We analysed parasite and host signatures in a cohort of \r\n      uncomplicated vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Brazil, combining clinical and \r\n      parasite parameters, multiplexed analysis of host responses, and ex vivo assays. \r\n      Patterns of clinical features, parasite burden, and host signatures measured in \r\n      plasma across the patient cohort were highly heterogenous. Further data \r\n      deconvolution revealed two patient clusters, here termed Vivax(low) and \r\n      Vivax(high). These patient subgroups were defined based on differences in total \r\n      parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. Overall Vivax(low) patients \r\n      clustered with healthy donors and Vivax(high) patients showed more profound \r\n      alterations in haematological parameters, endothelial cell (EC) activation, and \r\n      glycocalyx breakdown and levels of cytokines regulating different haematopoiesis \r\n      pathways compared to Vivax(low). Vivax(high) patients presented more severe \r\n      thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, along with enrichment of neutrophils in the \r\n      peripheral blood and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLCR). When \r\n      patients' signatures were combined, high association of total parasite biomass \r\n      with a subset of markers of EC activation, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia \r\n      severity was observed. Finally, machine learning models defined a combination of \r\n      host parameters measured in the circulation that could predict the extent of \r\n      parasite infection outside of circulation. Altogether, our data show that total \r\n      parasite biomass is a better predictor of perturbations in host homeostasis in P. \r\n      vivax patients than peripheral parasitaemia. This supports the emerging paradigm \r\n      of a P. vivax tissue reservoir, particularly in the haematopoietic niche of bone \r\n      marrow and spleen.\r\nCI  - © 2021, Silva-Filho et al.\r\nFAU -

Vaccination is the most efficient approach to prevent the spreading \r\n      of viral infection and promote individual and public health. In contrast, \r\n      exposure to environmental pollutants such as cigarette smoke reduces the efficacy \r\n      of vaccination. We investigated whether chronic exposure to hydroquinone (HQ), \r\n      the most abundant compound of the tobacco particulate phase, could impair the \r\n      adaptive immune responses elicited by influenza vaccination. For this, adult male \r\n      C57BL/6 mice were daily exposed to either nebulized HQ or PBS for 1 h for a total \r\n      of eight weeks. At weeks 6 and 8, the mice were primed and boosted with the \r\n      trivalent influenza vaccine via IM respectively. Although the HQ exposure did not \r\n      alter the body weight of the mice and the biochemical and hematological \r\n      parameters, the pollutant increased the oxidative stress in splenocytes of \r\n      immunized animals, modified the morphology of spleen follicles, and augmented the \r\n      size of their lymph nodes. The lymphoid organs of HQ-exposed mice presented a \r\n      similar number of vaccine-specific IgG-secreting cells, titers of \r\n      vaccine-specific total IgG, and respective subclasses. Transcriptome studies with \r\n      HQ, benzene, or cigarette smoke exposure were also analyzed. The genes \r\n      up-regulated upon pollutant exposure were associated with neutrophil migration \r\n      and were shown to be co-expressed with antibody-secreting cell genes.

The effects of variants in the KISS1, \r\n      KISS1R, and GNRHR genes and their possible association with assisted reproduction \r\n      outcomes remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used next-generation \r\n      sequencing to investigate the associations of the genetic diversity at the \r\n      candidate loci for KISS1, KISS1R, and GNRHR with the hormonal profiles and \r\n      reproductive outcomes in 86 women who underwent in vitro fertilization \r\n      treatments. Variants in the KISS1 and KISS1R genes were associated with \r\n      luteinizing hormone (rs35431622:T>C), anti-Mullerian hormone (rs71745629delT), \r\n      follicle-stimulating hormone (rs73507529:C>A), and estradiol (rs73507527:G>A, \r\n      rs350130:A>G, and rs73507529:C>A) levels, as well as with reproductive outcomes \r\n      such as the number of oocytes retrieved (s35431622:T>C), metaphasis II oocytes \r\n      (rs35431622:T>C), and embryos (rs1132506:G>C). Additionally, variants in the \r\n      GNRHR UTR3' (rs1038426:C>A, rs12508464:A>C, rs13150734:C>A, rs17635850:A>G, \r\n      rs35683646:G>A, rs35610027:C>G, rs35845954:T>C, rs17635749:C>T, and \r\n      rs7666201:C>T) were associated with low prolactin levels. A conjoint analysis of \r\n      clinical, hormonal, and genetic variables using a generalized linear model \r\n      identified two variants of the KISS1 gene (rs71745629delT and rs1132506:G>C) that \r\n      were significantly associated with hormonal variations and reproductive outcomes. \r\n      The findings suggest that variants in KISS1, KISS1R, and GNRHR genes can modulate \r\n      hormone levels and reproductive outcomes.\r\nFAU - Martins Trevisan, Camila\r\nAU  - Martins Trevisan C\r\nAD  - Discipline of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Populational Genetics, \r\n      Department of Collective Health, Centro Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo \r\n      André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Naslavsky, Michel Satya\r\nAU  - Naslavsky MS\r\nAD  - Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center, Biosciences Institute, Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Monfardini, Frederico\r\nAU  - Monfardini F\r\nAD  - Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center, Biosciences Institute, Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Wang, Jaqueline\r\nAU  - Wang J\r\nAD  - Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center, Biosciences Institute, Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Zatz, Mayana\r\nAU  - Zatz M\r\nAD  - Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center, Biosciences Institute, Universidade \r\n      de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Peluso, Carla\r\nAU  - Peluso C\r\nAD  - Discipline of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Populational Genetics, \r\n      Department of Collective Health, Centro Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo \r\n      André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pellegrino, Renata\r\nAU  - Pellegrino R\r\nAD  - Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, \r\n      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.\r\nFAU - Mafra, Fernanda\r\nAU  - Mafra F\r\nAD  - Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, \r\n      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.\r\nFAU - Hakonarson, Hakon\r\nAU  - Hakonarson H\r\nAD  - Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, \r\n      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Frederico Moraes\r\nAU  - Ferreira FM\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder\r\nAU  - Nakaya H\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Christofolini, Denise Maria\r\nAU  - Christofolini DM\r\nAD  - Discipline of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Populational Genetics, \r\n      Department of Collective Health, Centro Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo \r\n      André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Montagna, Erik\r\nAU  - Montagna E\r\nAD  - Postgraduation Program in Health Sciences, Research and Innovation, Centro \r\n      Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Crandall, Keith A\r\nAU  - Crandall KA\r\nAD  - Computational Biology Institute, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George \r\n      Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.\r\nFAU - Barbosa, Caio Parente\r\nAU  - Barbosa CP\r\nAD  - Discipline of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Populational Genetics, \r\n      Department of Collective Health, Centro Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo \r\n      André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Bianco, Bianca\r\nAU  - Bianco B\r\nAD  - Discipline of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Populational Genetics, \r\n      Department of Collective Health, Centro Universitário Saúde ABC, FMABC, Santo \r\n      André, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20200429\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - DNA Cell Biol\r\nJT  - DNA and cell biology\r\nJID - 9004522\r\nRN  - 0 (GNRHR protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (KISS1 protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (Kisspeptins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Kisspeptin-1)\r\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, LHRH)\r\nRN  - 33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - Genetic Loci/genetics\r\nMH  - *Genetic Variation\r\nMH  - Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*metabolism\r\nMH  - High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Infertility/genetics\r\nMH  - Kisspeptins/*genetics\r\nMH  - Receptors, Kisspeptin-1/*genetics\r\nMH  - Receptors, LHRH/*genetics\r\nMH  - Reproduction/*genetics\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - GNRHR\r\nOT  - KISS1\r\nOT  - KISS1R\r\nOT  - in vitro fertilization\r\nOT  - kisspeptin\r\nOT  - single nucleotide variation\r\nEDAT- 2020/05/01 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2020/06/17 06:00\r\nCRDT- 2020/05/01 06:00\r\nPHST- 2020/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/05/01 06:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - 10.1089/dna.2019.5165 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - DNA Cell Biol. 2020 Jun;39(6):1012-1022. doi: 10.1089/dna.2019.5165.

Whether such signatures are similar \r\n      across multiple seasons and in diverse populations is unknown. We applied systems \r\n      approaches to study immune responses in young, elderly, and diabetic subjects \r\n      vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine across five consecutive seasons. \r\n      Signatures of innate immunity and plasmablasts correlated with and predicted \r\n      influenza antibody titers at 1 month after vaccination with >80% accuracy across \r\n      multiple seasons but were not associated with the longevity of the response. \r\n      Baseline signatures of lymphocyte and monocyte inflammation were positively and \r\n      negatively correlated, respectively, with antibody responses at 1 month. Finally, \r\n      integrative analysis of microRNAs and transcriptomic profiling revealed potential \r\n      regulators of vaccine immunity. These results identify shared vaccine-induced \r\n      signatures across multiple seasons and in diverse populations and might help \r\n      guide the development of next-generation vaccines that provide persistent \r\n      immunity against influenza.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Partial sequences from two novel human genes were identified \r\n      and subsequently used for full length transcript cloning. RASL11A and ARL9 belong \r\n      to two novel subfamilies coding for small GTPases that we found to be highly \r\n      conserved among eukaryotes. The Arl9/Arl10 subfamily displays a conserved \r\n      interswitch toggle that places it evolutionarily closer to the Arf family. Rasl11 \r\n      proteins are more closely related to the Ras branch of GTPases. All orthologues \r\n      newly identified here exhibit an Asn residue in place of the highly conserved \r\n      Thr35 of the G domain, suggesting that the universal switch mechanism of small \r\n      GTPases may be structurally different in this subfamily. We determined by \r\n      Northern blot that RASL11A is transcribed in several human tissues and that it is \r\n      down-regulated in prostate tumors as measured by quantitative real-time PCR. \r\n      These results highlight a previously uncharacterized subfamily of Ras-related \r\n      genes that may have a tumor suppressor role in prostate cancer.\r\nFAU - Louro, Rodrigo\r\nAU  - Louro R\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, \r\n      05508-900 São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Paquola, Apuã C M\r\nAU  - Paquola AC\r\nFAU - Martins, Elizabeth A L\r\nAU  - Martins EA\r\nFAU - da Silva, Aline M\r\nAU  - da Silva AM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Biochem Biophys Res Commun\r\nJT  - Biochemical and biophysical research communications\r\nJID - 0372516\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)\r\nRN  - EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)\r\nRN  - EC 3.6.1.- (RASL11A protein, human)\r\nRN  - EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)\r\nRN  - EC 3.6.5.2 (ARL9 protein, human)\r\nRN  - EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - ADP-Ribosylation Factors/*biosynthesis/*genetics\r\nMH  - Amino Acid Sequence\r\nMH  - Blotting, Northern\r\nMH  - Cloning, Molecular\r\nMH  - Conserved Sequence\r\nMH  - *Down-Regulation\r\nMH  - Expressed Sequence Tags\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - GTP Phosphohydrolases/chemistry/metabolism\r\nMH  - *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic\r\nMH  - Genome, Human\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Models, Genetic\r\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\r\nMH  - Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics\r\nMH  - Phylogeny\r\nMH  - Prostate/metabolism\r\nMH  - Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Protein Structure, Tertiary\r\nMH  - RNA, Messenger/metabolism\r\nMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nMH  - Sequence Homology, Amino Acid\r\nMH  - Tissue Distribution\r\nEDAT- 2004/03/23 05:00\r\nMHDA- 2004/05/21 05:00\r\nCRDT- 2004/03/23 05:00\r\nPHST- 2004/01/07 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - S0006291X04003419 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.091 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Apr 9;316(3):618-27. doi: \r\n      10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.091.\r\n\r\nPMID- 22246032\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20120424\r\nLR  - 20211021\r\nIS  - 1528-0020 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0006-4971 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0006-4971 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 119\r\nIP  - 9\r\nDP  - 2012 Mar 1\r\nTI  - Distinct TLR adjuvants differentially stimulate systemic and local innate immune \r\n      responses in nonhuman primates.\r\nPG  - 2044-55\r\nLID - 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388579 [doi]\r\nAB  - TLR ligands (TLR-Ls) represent novel vaccine adjuvants, but their immunologic \r\n      effects in humans remain poorly defined in vivo. In the present study, we \r\n      analyzed the innate responses stimulated by different TLR-Ls in rhesus macaques. \r\n      MPL (TLR4-L), R-848 (TLR7/8-L), or cytosine-phosphate-guanine \r\n      oligodeoxynucleotide (TLR9-L) induced a rapid and robust expansion of blood \r\n      neutrophils, with a concomitant reduction in PBMCs. Furthermore, all TLR-Ls \r\n      induced rapid (3-8 hours) expansion of CD14(+) monocytes, but only TLR7/8-L and \r\n      TLR9-L mobilized the CD14(+)CD16(+) and CD14(dim)CD16(++) monocytes, and only \r\n      TLR7/8-L and TLR9-L induced activation of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and \r\n      plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), production of IP-10 and type-I IFN, and expression of \r\n      type-I IFN-related and chemokine genes in the blood. In the draining lymph nodes \r\n      (LNs), consistent with the effects in blood, all TLR-Ls induced expansion of \r\n      CD14(+) monocytes, but only TLR7/8-L and TLR9-L expanded the activated \r\n      CD14(+)CD16(+) cells. TLR4-L and TLR9-L differentially induced the expansion of \r\n      mDCs and pDCs (1-3 days), but did not activate DCs. In contrast, TLR7/8-L did not \r\n      induce DC expansion, but did activate mDCs. Finally, both TLR9-L and TLR7/8-L \r\n      induced the expression of genes related to chemokines and type-I IFNs in LNs. \r\n      Thus different TLR-Ls mediate distinct signatures of early innate responses both \r\n      locally and systemically.\r\nFAU - Kwissa, Marcin\r\nAU  - Kwissa M\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center and Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory \r\n      University, 954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Oluoch, Herold\r\nAU  - Oluoch H\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI096187/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - 5U19 AI057266-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - 1P01AI096187-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nDEP - 20120112\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Blood\r\nJT  - Blood\r\nJID - 7603509\r\nRN  - 0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)\r\nRN  - 0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)\r\nRN  - 0 (Imidazoles)\r\nRN  - 0 (Inflammation Mediators)\r\nRN  - 0 (Ligands)\r\nRN  - 0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)\r\nRN  - 0 (Toll-Like Receptors)\r\nRN  - V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - Immunity, Innate/genetics/*immunology\r\nMH  - Inflammation Mediators/metabolism\r\nMH  - Injections, Intradermal\r\nMH  - Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Ligands\r\nMH  - Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Macaca mulatta/immunology\r\nMH  - Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism\r\nMH  - Neutrophils/immunology\r\nMH  - Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology\r\nMH  - Toll-Like Receptors/*agonists\r\nMH  - Transcription, Genetic/drug effects\r\nPMC - PMC3311246\r\nEDAT- 2012/01/17 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2012/04/25 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/03/01\r\nCRDT- 2012/01/17 06:00\r\nPHST- 2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - S0006-4971(20)46009-4 [pii]\r\nAID - 2011/388579 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388579 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Blood. 2012 Mar 1;119(9):2044-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388579.

Here we show the construction and use of a cDNA microarray \r\n      platform enriched in intronic transcripts to assess their biological relevance in \r\n      pathological conditions. To validate the approach, prostate cancer was used as a \r\n      model, and 27 patient tumor samples with Gleason scores ranging from 5 to 10 were \r\n      analyzed. We find that a considerably higher fraction (6.6%, [23/346]) of \r\n      intronic transcripts are significantly correlated (P< or =0.001) to the degree of \r\n      prostate tumor differentiation (Gleason score) when compared to transcripts from \r\n      unannotated genomic regions (1%, [6/539]) or from exons of known genes (2%, \r\n      [27/1369]).

We found evidence of alternatively spliced \r\n      mRNAs for human TLE1-4 containing premature stop codons, thus encoding putative \r\n      shortened proteins. Microarray experiments and Real-time RT-PCR assays showed \r\n      that alternatively spliced isoforms of TLE1, TLE2 an d TLE3 were preferentially \r\n      expressed in prostate in comparison to liver and kidney tissues. We identified by \r\n      orientation-specific R T-PCR an antisense partially intronic non-coding RNA that \r\n      overlaps a novel exon of the TLE3 gene, raising the possibility of regulation of \r\n      alternative splicing by this non-coding transcript. The alternatively spliced \r\n      isoform of TLE3 was up-regulated (6- to 17-fo ld) in prostate tumors in \r\n      comparison to matched non-tumor adjacent tissue from 7 out of 11 (64%) patients \r\n      and in four prostate tumor cell lines in comparison to a normal prostate cell \r\n      line. These results demonstrate that different isoforms of TLE genes are commonly \r\n      transcribed in human tissues and suggest that TLE3 could be involved in prostate \r\n      cancer development.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, \r\n      05508-900 Sao Pau lo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Beckedorff, Felipe C\r\nAU  - Beckedorff FC\r\nFAU - Baldini, Maria L\r\nAU  - Baldini ML\r\nFAU - Fachel, Angela A\r\nAU  - Fachel AA\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20071026\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Biochem Biophys Res Commun\r\nJT  - Biochemical and biophysical research communications\r\nJID - 0372516\r\nRN  - 0 (Protein Isoforms)\r\nRN  - 0 (Repressor Proteins)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Cell Line, Tumor\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Kidney/metabolism\r\nMH  - Liver/metabolism\r\nMH  - Male\r\nMH  - Organ Specificity\r\nMH  - Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics\r\nMH  - Protein Isoforms/classification/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - RNA Splicing/*genetics\r\nMH  - Repressor Proteins/classification/*genetics/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Up-Regulation/*genetics\r\nEDAT- 2008/02/15 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2008/03/01 09:00\r\nCRDT- 2008/02/15 09:00\r\nPHST- 2007/09/18 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2007/10/17 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]\r\nAID - S0006-291X(07)02263-2 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.097 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Dec 28;364(4):918-23. doi: \r\n      10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.097.

Herein, we show \r\n      that SerpinB2(-/-) mice are more susceptible to contact dermatitis after topical \r\n      application of dinitrofluorobenzene, and show enhanced inflammatory lesions after \r\n      topical applications of phorbol ester. Untreated SerpinB2(-/-) mice showed no \r\n      overt changes in epithelial structure, and we were unable to find evidence for a \r\n      role for keratinocyte SerpinB2 in regulating immunity, apoptosis, IL-1β \r\n      production, proteasomal activity, or wound healing. Instead, the phenotype was \r\n      associated with impaired skin barrier function and a defective stratum corneum, \r\n      with SerpinB2(-/-) mice showing increased transepidermal water loss, increased \r\n      overt loss of stratum corneum in inflammatory lesions, and impaired stratum \r\n      corneum thickening after phorbol ester treatment. Immunoblotting suggested that \r\n      SerpinB2 (cross-linked into the cornified envelope) is present in the stratum \r\n      corneum and retains the ability to form covalent inhibitory complexes with \r\n      urokinase. Data suggest that the function of keratinocyte SerpinB2 is protection \r\n      of the stratum corneum from proteolysis via inhibition of urokinase, thereby \r\n      maintaining the integrity and barrier function of the stratum corneum, \r\n      particularly during times of skin inflammation. Implications for studies \r\n      involving genetically modified mice treated with topical agents and \r\n      human dermatological conditions, such as contact dermatitis, are discussed.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Here we demonstrate that cysteine protease-induced T(H)2 responses \r\n      occur via 'cooperation' between migratory dermal dendritic cells (DCs) and \r\n      basophils positive for interleukin 4 (IL-4). Subcutaneous immunization with \r\n      papain plus antigen induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymph node DCs and \r\n      in dermal DCs and epithelial cells of the skin. ROS orchestrated T(H)2 responses \r\n      by inducing oxidized lipids that triggered the induction of thymic stromal \r\n      lymphopoietin (TSLP) by epithelial cells mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) \r\n      and the adaptor protein TRIF; by suppressing production of the T(H)1-inducing \r\n      molecules IL-12 and CD70 in lymph node DCs; and by inducing the DC-derived \r\n      chemokine CCL7, which mediated recruitment of IL-4(+) basophils to the lymph \r\n      node. Thus, the T(H)2 response to cysteine proteases requires DC-basophil \r\n      cooperation via ROS-mediated signaling.\r\nFAU - Tang, Hua\r\nAU  - Tang H\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.\r\nFAU - Cao, Weiping\r\nAU  - Cao W\r\nFAU - Kasturi, Sudhir Pai\r\nAU  - Kasturi SP\r\nFAU - Ravindran, Rajesh\r\nAU  - Ravindran R\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Kundu, Kousik\r\nAU  - Kundu K\r\nFAU - Murthy, Niren\r\nAU  - Murthy N\r\nFAU - Kepler, Thomas B\r\nAU  - Kepler TB\r\nFAU - Malissen, Bernard\r\nAU  - Malissen B\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE21602\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - HHSN266200700006C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 HL096796/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37AI48638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01 AI050019/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54 AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - HHSN266 200700006C/PHS HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - N01 AI050025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20100523\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Nat Immunol\r\nJT  - Nature immunology\r\nJID - 100941354\r\nRN  - 0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)\r\nRN  - 0 (Antigens)\r\nRN  - 0 (Cytokines)\r\nRN  - 0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)\r\nRN  - 0 (TICAM-1 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)\r\nRN  - 207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)\r\nRN  - EC 3.4.22.2 (Papain)\r\nRN  - GT0IL38SP4 (Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin)\r\nRN  - 0 (TSLP protein, mouse)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/metabolism\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Antigens/immunology\r\nMH  - Basophils/immunology/*metabolism/pathology\r\nMH  - Cell Communication\r\nMH  - Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics\r\nMH  - Epithelial Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology\r\nMH  - Interleukin-4/biosynthesis\r\nMH  - Langerhans Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology\r\nMH  - Lymphocyte Activation\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred BALB C\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Mice, Transgenic\r\nMH  - Papain/immunology\r\nMH  - Reactive Oxygen Species/immunology/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Signal Transduction\r\nMH  - Th2 Cells/*immunology\r\nMH  - Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism\r\nMH  - Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin\r\nPMC - PMC3145206\r\nMID - NIHMS312293\r\nEDAT- 2010/05/25 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2010/09/08 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2011/07/28\r\nCRDT- 2010/05/25 06:00\r\nPHST- 2010/01/04 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2010/05/03 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2011/07/28 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - ni.1883 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1038/ni.1883 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Nat Immunol. 2010 Jul;11(7):608-17. doi: 10.1038/ni.1883.

In Brazil, it is caused by Leishmania \r\n      infantum parasites. Blood transcriptomics allows us to assess the molecular \r\n      mechanisms involved in the immunopathological processes of several clinical \r\n      conditions, namely, parasitic diseases. Here, we performed mRNA sequencing of \r\n      peripheral blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis during the active \r\n      phase of the disease and six months after successful treatment, when the patients \r\n      were considered clinically cured. To strengthen the study, the RNA-seq data \r\n      analysis included two other non-diseased groups composed of healthy uninfected \r\n      volunteers and asymptomatic individuals. We identified thousands of \r\n      differentially expressed genes between VL patients and non-diseased groups. \r\n      Overall, pathway analysis corroborated the importance of signaling involving \r\n      interferons, chemokines, Toll-like receptors and the neutrophil response. \r\n      Cellular deconvolution of gene expression profiles was able to discriminate \r\n      cellular subtypes, highlighting the contribution of plasma cells and NK cells in \r\n      the course of the disease. Beyond the biological processes involved in the \r\n      immunopathology of VL revealed by the expression of protein coding genes (PCGs), \r\n      we observed a significant participation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in our \r\n      blood transcriptome dataset. Genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs expression in VL has \r\n      never been performed. lncRNAs have been considered key regulators of disease \r\n      progression, mainly in cancers; however, their pattern regulation may also help \r\n      to understand the complexity and heterogeneity of host immune responses elicited \r\n      by L. infantum infections in humans. Among our findings, we identified lncRNAs \r\n      such as IL21-AS1, MIR4435-2HG and LINC01501 and coexpressed lncRNA/mRNA pairs \r\n      such as CA3-AS1/CA1, GASAL1/IFNG and LINC01127/IL1R1-IL1R2. Thus, for the first \r\n      time, we present an integrated analysis of PCGs and lncRNAs by exploring the \r\n      lncRNA-mRNA coexpression profile of VL to provide insights into the regulatory \r\n      gene network involved in the development of this inflammatory and infectious \r\n      disease.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2022 Maruyama, Fuzo, Oliveira, Rogerio, Takamiya, Pessenda, de Melo, \r\n      da Silva, Jesus, Carregaro, Nakaya, Almeida and da Silva.\r\nFAU - Maruyama, Sandra Regina\r\nAU  - Maruyama SR\r\nAD  - Department of Genetics and Evolution, Center for Biological Sciences and Health, \r\n      Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fuzo, Carlos Alessandro\r\nAU  - Fuzo CA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, Ribeirão Preto \r\n      School of Pharmaceutics Sciences, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Antonio Edson R\r\nAU  - Oliveira AER\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Rogerio, Luana Aparecida\r\nAU  - Rogerio LA\r\nAD  - Department of Genetics and Evolution, Center for Biological Sciences and Health, \r\n      Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Takamiya, Nayore Tamie\r\nAU  - Takamiya NT\r\nAD  - Department of Genetics and Evolution, Center for Biological Sciences and Health, \r\n      Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pessenda, Gabriela\r\nAU  - Pessenda G\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, \r\n      University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - de Melo, Enaldo Vieira\r\nAU  - de Melo EV\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, University Hospital-Empresa Brasileira de Serviços \r\n      Hospitalares (EBSERH), Federal University of Sergipe, Aracaju, Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Silva, Angela Maria\r\nAU  - da Silva AM\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, University Hospital-Empresa Brasileira de Serviços \r\n      Hospitalares (EBSERH), Federal University of Sergipe, Aracaju, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Jesus, Amélia Ribeiro\r\nAU  - Jesus AR\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, University Hospital-Empresa Brasileira de Serviços \r\n      Hospitalares (EBSERH), Federal University of Sergipe, Aracaju, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Carregaro, Vanessa\r\nAU  - Carregaro V\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, \r\n      University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Almeida, Roque Pacheco\r\nAU  - Almeida RP\r\nAD  - Department of Medicine, University Hospital-Empresa Brasileira de Serviços \r\n      Hospitalares (EBSERH), Federal University of Sergipe, Aracaju, Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Silva, João Santana\r\nAU  - da Silva JS\r\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, \r\n      University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fiocruz-Bi-Institutional Translational Medicine Platform, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20220315\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Leishmania infantum/genetics\r\nMH  - *Leishmaniasis\r\nMH  - *Leishmaniasis, Visceral/genetics\r\nMH  - *RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics\r\nMH  - RNA, Messenger/genetics\r\nMH  - Transcriptome\r\nPMC - PMC8965071\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - Leishmania infantum (syn.

A fraction of PTC cases show loss of differentiation and \r\n      aggressive behavior, with radioiodine therapy resistance and metastasis. Although \r\n      microRNAs (miRNAs) emerged as promising molecular markers for PTC, their role in \r\n      the loss of differentiation observed during PTC progression remains to be fully \r\n      understood. We performed the large-scale analysis of miRNA expression during PTC \r\n      progression in BRAFT1799A-transgenic animals (Tg-Braf) and thyroid cancer cell \r\n      lines and identified the marked downregulation of several miRNAs from the region \r\n      14q32. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) confirmed the global \r\n      downregulation of miRNAs from the 14q32 region in human PTC. The regulatory \r\n      network potentially suppressed by these miRNAs suggests that key cancer-related \r\n      biological processes such as cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and \r\n      angiogenesis. Among the downregulated miRNAs, we observed that miR-654-3p levels \r\n      decrease with long-term PTC progression in Tg-Braf mice and inversely correlate \r\n      with EMT. The in vitro restoration of miR-654-3p decreased cell proliferation and \r\n      migration and induced reprogramming of metastasis-related genes, suggesting a \r\n      tumor suppressor role for this miRNA. In conclusion, we show global \r\n      downregulation of 14q32-encoded miRNAs in an in vivo model of PTC progression. \r\n      The potential circuitry in which these miRNAs are involved suggests that these \r\n      miRNAs could play a key role in the pathophysiology of PTC and therefore be \r\n      relevant for the development of new therapeutic strategies.\r\nFAU - Geraldo, Murilo Vieira\r\nAU  - Geraldo MV\r\nAD  - Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, \r\n      University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Structural and Functional Biology, Institute of Biology, State \r\n      University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder Imoto\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Kimura, Edna Teruko\r\nAU  - Kimura ET\r\nAD  - Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, \r\n      University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Oncotarget\r\nJT  - Oncotarget\r\nJID - 101532965\r\nRN  - 0 (MicroRNAs)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Carcinoma, Papillary/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Cell Line, Tumor\r\nMH  - *Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14\r\nMH  - Disease Progression\r\nMH  - Down-Regulation\r\nMH  - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition\r\nMH  - *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic\r\nMH  - Gene Regulatory Networks\r\nMH  - Genetic Predisposition to Disease\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Mice, Transgenic\r\nMH  - MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Mutation\r\nMH  - Phenotype\r\nMH  - Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics\r\nMH  - RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional\r\nMH  - Signal Transduction\r\nMH  - Thyroid Cancer, Papillary\r\nMH  - Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Time Factors\r\nPMC - PMC5354756\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - 14q32 region\r\nOT  - metastasis\r\nOT  - microRNA\r\nOT  - microTranscriptome\r\nOT  - papillary thyroid carcinoma\r\nCOIS- CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest that could \r\n      prejudice the impartiality of this work.\r\nEDAT- 2016/12/29 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2018/02/23 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2017/02/07\r\nCRDT- 2016/12/29 06:00\r\nPHST- 2016/09/18 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2016/11/26 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2016/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2016/12/29 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2017/02/07 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 14162 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.18632/oncotarget.14162 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 7;8(6):9597-9607. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14162.\r\n\r\nPMID- 29269773\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20190730\r\nLR  - 20200306\r\nIS  - 2045-2322 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2045-2322 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 7\r\nIP  - 1\r\nDP  - 2017 Dec 21\r\nTI  - Integration of miRNA and gene expression profiles suggest a role for miRNAs in \r\n      the pathobiological processes of acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection.\r\nPG  - 17990\r\nLID - 10.1038/s41598-017-18080-9 [doi]\r\nLID - 17990\r\nAB  - Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin \r\n      America.

Pathways, \r\n      functional and upstream regulator analysis of the intersections between predicted \r\n      targets of differentially expressed microRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs \r\n      revealed enrichment in biological processes and pathways such as IFNγ, TNFα, \r\n      NF-kB signaling signatures, CTL-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, \r\n      and Nrf2-modulated antioxidative responses. We also observed enrichment in other \r\n      key heart disease-related processes like myocarditis, fibrosis, hypertrophy and \r\n      arrhythmia. Our correlation study suggests that miRNAs may be implicated in the \r\n      pathophysiological processes taking place the hearts of acutely T. cruzi-infected \r\n      mice.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto\r\nAU  -

971\r\nLID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.00971 [doi]\r\nLID - 971\r\nAB  - Transcriptome analyses have increased our understanding of the molecular \r\n      mechanisms underlying human diseases. Most approaches aim to identify significant \r\n      genes by comparing their expression values between healthy subjects and a group \r\n      of patients with a certain disease. Given that studies normally contain few \r\n      samples, the heterogeneity among individuals caused by environmental factors or \r\n      undetected illnesses can impact gene expression analyses. We present a systematic \r\n      analysis of sample heterogeneity in a variety of gene expression studies relating \r\n      to inflammatory and infectious diseases and show that novel immunological \r\n      insights may arise once heterogeneity is addressed. The perturbation score of \r\n      samples is quantified using nonperturbed subjects (i.e., healthy subjects) as a \r\n      reference group. Such a score allows us to detect outlying samples and subgroups \r\n      of diseased patients and even assess the molecular perturbation of single cells \r\n      infected with viruses. We also show how removal of outlying samples can improve \r\n      the \"signal\" of the disease and impact detection of differentially expressed \r\n      genes. The method is made available via the mdp Bioconductor R package and as a \r\n      user-friendly webtool, webMDP, available at http://mdp.sysbio.tools.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2019 Gonçalves, Lever, Russo, Gomes-Correia, Urbanski, Pollara, \r\n      Noursadeghi, Maracaja-Coutinho and Nakaya.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, André N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lever, Melissa\r\nAU  - Lever M\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Russo, Pedro S T\r\nAU  - Russo PST\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gomes-Correia, Bruno\r\nAU  - Gomes-Correia B\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases-ACCDiS, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Urbanski, Alysson H\r\nAU  - Urbanski AH\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pollara, Gabriele\r\nAU  - Pollara G\r\nAD  - Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United \r\n      Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Noursadeghi, Mahdad\r\nAU  - Noursadeghi M\r\nAD  - Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United \r\n      Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Maracaja-Coutinho, Vinicius\r\nAU  - Maracaja-Coutinho V\r\nAD  - Advanced Center for Chronic Diseases-ACCDiS, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y \r\n      Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-USP, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20191024\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Genet\r\nJT  - Frontiers in genetics\r\nJID - 101560621\r\nPMC - PMC6822058\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - gene expression profiling\r\nOT  - heterogeneity\r\nOT  - infectious diseases\r\nOT  - inflammatory diseases\r\nOT  - transcriptome analysis\r\nEDAT- 2019/11/12 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2019/11/12 06:01\r\nPMCR- 2019/10/24\r\nCRDT- 2019/11/12 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/04/09 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2019/09/11 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2019/10/24 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.00971 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Genet. 2019 Oct 24;10:971. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.00971. eCollection 2019.\r\n\r\nPMID- 32511627\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nLR  - 20240329\r\nDP  - 2020 Mar 27\r\nTI  - ACE2 Expression is Increased in the Lungs of Patients with Comorbidities \r\n      Associated with Severe COVID-19.\r\nLID - 2020.03.21.20040261 [pii]\r\nLID - 10.1101/2020.03.21.20040261 [doi]\r\nAB  - The pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 \r\n      (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in several thousand deaths worldwide in just a few \r\n      months. Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had \r\n      comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung \r\n      disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial \r\n      factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study \r\n      has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. \r\n      Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with \r\n      comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly \r\n      expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding \r\n      suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of \r\n      developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be \r\n      important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses \r\n      revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes \r\n      related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, \r\n      epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by \r\n      KDM5B. Our systems biology approach offers a possible explanation for increase of \r\n      COVID-19 severity in patients with certain comorbidities.\r\nFAU - Pinto, Bruna G G\r\nAU  - Pinto BGG\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Oliveira, Antonio E R\r\nAU  - Oliveira AER\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Singh, Youvika\r\nAU  - Singh Y\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Jimenez, Leandro\r\nAU  - Jimenez L\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonçalves, Andre N A\r\nAU  - Gonçalves ANA\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Ogava, Rodrigo L T\r\nAU  - Ogava RLT\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Creighton, Rachel\r\nAU  - Creighton R\r\nAD  - Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\r\nFAU - Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann\r\nAU  - Peron JPS\r\nAD  - Neuroimmune Interactions Laboratory - Department of Immunology - Institute of \r\n      Biomedical Sciences - University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Here we evaluated \r\n      viral carriage by RT-PCR and seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM \r\n      and IgG) by immunochromatography in 2259 individuals (1139 students and 1120 \r\n      school workers) from 28 schools in 28 Brazilian cities. We collected the samples \r\n      within 30 days after public schools reopened and before the start of vaccination \r\n      campaigns. Most students (n = 421) and school workers (n = 446) had active \r\n      (qRT-PCR + IgM- IgG- or qRT-PCR + IgM + IgG-/+) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regression \r\n      analysis indicated a strong association between the infection status of students \r\n      and school workers. Furthermore, while 45% (n = 515) of the students and 37% (n = \r\n      415) of the school workers were neither antigen nor antibody positive in \r\n      laboratory tests, 16% of the participants (169 students and 193 school workers) \r\n      were oligosymptomatic, including those reinfected. These individuals presented \r\n      mild symptoms such as headache, sore throat, and cough. Notably, most of the \r\n      individuals were asymptomatic (83.9%). These results indicate that many \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 infections in Brazilian cities during school reopening were \r\n      asymptomatic. Thus, our study highlights the need to promote a coordinated public \r\n      health effort to guarantee a safe educational environment while avoiding \r\n      exacerbating pre-existent social inequalities in Brazil, reducing social, mental, \r\n      and economic losses for students, school workers, and their families.\r\nCI  -

Chagas disease affects \r\n      8 million people worldwide, and chronic production of the cytokines IFN-γ and \r\n      TNF-α by T cells together with mitochondrial dysfunction are important players \r\n      for the poor prognosis of the disease. Mitochondria occupy 40% of the \r\n      cardiomyocytes volume and produce 95% of cellular ATP that sustain the life-long \r\n      cycles of heart contraction. As IFN-γ and TNF-α have been described to affect \r\n      mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that IFN-γ and TNF-α are involved in the \r\n      myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction observed in CCC patients. In this study, we \r\n      quantified markers of mitochondrial dysfunction and nitro-oxidative stress in CCC \r\n      heart tissue and in IFN-γ/TNF-α-stimulated AC-16 human cardiomyocytes. We found \r\n      that CCC myocardium displayed increased levels of nitro-oxidative stress and \r\n      reduced mitochondrial DNA as compared with myocardial tissue from patients with \r\n      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). IFN-γ/TNF-α treatment of AC-16 cardiomyocytes \r\n      induced increased nitro-oxidative stress and decreased the mitochondrial membrane \r\n      potential (ΔΨm). We found that the STAT1/NF-κB/NOS2 axis is involved in the \r\n      IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced decrease of ΔΨm in AC-16 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, \r\n      treatment with mitochondria-sparing agonists of AMPK, NRF2 and SIRT1 rescues ΔΨm \r\n      in IFN-γ/TNF-α-stimulated cells. Proteomic and gene expression analyses revealed \r\n      that IFN-γ/TNF-α-treated cells corroborate mitochondrial dysfunction, \r\n      transmembrane potential of mitochondria, altered fatty acid metabolism and \r\n      cardiac necrosis/cell death. Functional assays conducted on Seahorse respirometer \r\n      showed that cytokine-stimulated cells display decreased glycolytic and \r\n      mitochondrial ATP production, dependency of fatty acid oxidation as well as \r\n      increased proton leak and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Together, our \r\n      results suggest that IFN-γ and TNF-α cause direct damage to cardiomyocytes' \r\n      mitochondria by promoting oxidative and nitrosative stress and impairing energy \r\n      production pathways. We hypothesize that treatment with agonists of AMPK, NRF2 \r\n      and SIRT1 might be an approach to ameliorate the progression of Chagas disease \r\n      cardiomyopathy.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 Nunes, Andrieux, Brochet, Almeida, Kitano, Honda, Iwai, \r\n      Andrade-Silva, Goudenège, Alcântara Silva, Vieira, Levy, Bydlowski, Gallardo, \r\n      Torres, Bocchi, Mano, Santos, Bacal, Pomerantzeff, Laurindo, Teixeira, Nakaya, \r\n      Kalil, Procaccio, Chevillard and Cunha-Neto.\r\nFAU -

624191\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.624191 [doi]\r\nLID - 624191\r\nAB  - In spite of several decades of research, an effective vaccine against \r\n      schistosomiasis remains elusive. The radiation-attenuated (RA) cercarial vaccine \r\n      is still the best model eliciting high protection levels, although the immune \r\n      mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized. In order to identify genes and \r\n      pathways underlying protection we investigated patterns of gene expression in \r\n      PBMC and skin draining Lymph Nodes (LN) from mice using two exposure comparisons: \r\n      vaccination with 500 attenuated cercariae versus infection with 500 normal \r\n      cercariae; one versus three doses. Vaccinated mice were challenged with 120 \r\n      normal parasites. Integration of PBMC and LN data from the infected group \r\n      revealed early up-regulation of pathways associated with Th2 skewing and \r\n      polarization of IgG antibody profiles. Additionally, hemostasis pathways were \r\n      downregulated in infected mice, correlating with platelet reduction, potentially \r\n      a mechanism to assist parasite migration through capillary beds. Conversely, up \r\n      regulation of such mechanisms after vaccination may explain parasite blockade in \r\n      the lungs. In contrast, a single exposure to attenuated parasites revealed early \r\n      establishment of a Th1 bias (signaling of IL-1, IFN-γ; and Leishmania infection). \r\n      Genes encoding chemokines and their receptors were more prominent in vaccinated \r\n      mice, indicating an enhanced capacity for inflammation, potentially augmenting \r\n      the inhibition of intravascular migration. Increasing the vaccinations from one \r\n      to three did not dramatically elevate protection, but there was a clear shift \r\n      towards antibody-mediated effectors. However, elements of the Th1 bias were still \r\n      evident. Notable features after three vaccinations were markers of cytotoxicity \r\n      (including IL-6 and NK cells) together with growth factors and their receptors \r\n      (FGFR/VEGF/EGF) and the apoptosis pathway. Indeed, there is evidence for the \r\n      development of anergy after three vaccinations, borne out by the limited \r\n      responses detected in samples after challenge. We infer that persistence of a Th1 \r\n      response puts a limit on expression of antibody-mediated mechanisms. This feature \r\n      may explain the failure of multiple doses to drive protection towards sterile \r\n      immunity. We suggest that the secretions of lung stage parasites would make a \r\n      novel cohort of antigens for testing in protection experiments.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2021 Farias, Vitoriano-Souza, Cardozo, Gama, Singh, Miyasato, \r\n      Almeida, Rodriguez, Barbosa, Fernandes, Barbosa, Neto, Nakano, Ho, \r\n      Verjovski-Almeida, Nakaya, Wilson and Leite.\r\nFAU -

Spatial and temporal \r\n      analyses were conducted to characterize various aspects of the outbreak, \r\n      including the onset and prevalence of symptoms, demographics, and vaccination \r\n      status. A visualization tool was also constructed to display the geographical and \r\n      temporal distribution of the reported measles cases. RESULTS: Approximately 95% \r\n      of the included participants had not received vaccination within the past decade. \r\n      Heterogeneity was observed across all facets of the outbreak, including \r\n      variations in the incubation period and symptom presentation. Age distribution \r\n      exhibited two peaks, occurring at one year and 18 years of age, and the potential \r\n      implications of this distribution on predictive analysis were discussed. \r\n      Additionally, spatial analysis revealed that areas with the highest case \r\n      densities tended to have the lowest standard of living. CONCLUSION: Understanding \r\n      the spatial and temporal spread of measles outbreaks provides insights for \r\n      decision-making regarding measures to mitigate future epidemics.\r\nFAU - Martins, Felipe de Mello\r\nAU  - Martins FM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1759-0698\r\nAD  - Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, \r\n      AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Vidal, Alessandra Pinheiro\r\nAU  - Vidal AP\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3563-0606\r\nAD  - Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, \r\n      AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Giddaluru, Jeevan\r\nAU  - Giddaluru J\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8043-7162\r\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - da Silva, Bernardo Maia\r\nAU  - da Silva BM\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5989-1288\r\nAD  - Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Manaus, \r\n      AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Lee, Eva K\r\nAU  - Lee EK\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0415-4640\r\nAD  - Center for Operations Research in Medicine and Healthcare, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology, Atlanta, USA.\r\nFAU - Zhang, Peijue\r\nAU  - Zhang P\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0902-3554\r\nAD  - Center for Operations Research in Medicine and Healthcare, Georgia Institute of \r\n      Technology, Atlanta, USA.\r\nFAU - Cardozo, Lucas Esteves\r\nAU  - Cardozo LE\r\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, \r\n      Brazil.\r\nFAU - Prete Junior, Carlos Augusto\r\nAU  - Prete Junior CA\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3907-423X\r\nAD  - Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Escola Politécnica, Universidade de \r\n      São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Domingues, Helves Humberto\r\nAU  - Domingues HH\r\nAD  - Instituto de Medicinal Tropical, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sabino, Ester Cerdeira\r\nAU  - Sabino EC\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2623-5126\r\nAD  - Instituto de Medicinal Tropical, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Sampaio, Vanderson de Souza\r\nAU  - Sampaio VS\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7307-8851\r\nAD  - Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, AM, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Fundação de Vigilância em Saúde do Amazonas Dra.

To better \r\n      evaluate the recent evolution of the X. fastidiosa chromosome backbone among \r\n      distinct pathovars, the number and location of prophage-like regions on two \r\n      finished genomes (9a5c and Temecula1), and in two candidate molecules (Ann1 and \r\n      Dixon) were assessed. Based on comparative best bidirectional hit analyses, the \r\n      majority (51%) of the predicted genes in the X. fastidiosa prophage-like regions \r\n      are related to structural phage genes belonging to the Siphoviridae family. \r\n      Electron micrograph reveals the existence of putative viral particles with \r\n      similar morphology to lambda phages in the bacterial cell in planta. Moreover, \r\n      analysis of microarray data indicates that 9a5c strain cultivated under stress \r\n      conditions presents enhanced expression of phage anti-repressor genes, suggesting \r\n      switches from lysogenic to lytic cycle of phages under stress-induced situations. \r\n      Furthermore, virulence-associated proteins and toxins are found within these \r\n      prophage-like elements, thus suggesting an important role in host adaptation. \r\n      Finally, clustering analyses of phage integrase genes based on multiple alignment \r\n      patterns reveal they group in five lineages, all possessing a tyrosine \r\n      recombinase catalytic domain, and phylogenetically close to other integrases \r\n      found in phages that are genetic mosaics and able to perform generalized and \r\n      specialized transduction. Integration sites and tRNA association is also \r\n      evidenced. In summary, we present comparative and experimental evidence \r\n      supporting the association and contribution of phage activity on the \r\n      differentiation of Xylella genomes.\r\nFAU - de Mello Varani, Alessandro\r\nAU  - de Mello Varani A\r\nAD  - Genome and Transposable Elements Laboratory (GaTE Lab), Departamento de Botânica, \r\n      Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Souza, Rangel Celso\r\nAU  - Souza RC\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - de Lima, Wanessa Cristina\r\nAU  - de Lima WC\r\nFAU - Paula de Almeida, Luiz Gonzaga\r\nAU  - Paula de Almeida LG\r\nFAU - Kitajima, Elliot Watanabe\r\nAU  - Kitajima EW\r\nFAU - Chen, Jianchi\r\nAU  - Chen J\r\nFAU - Civerolo, Edwin\r\nAU  - Civerolo E\r\nFAU - Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza Ribeiro\r\nAU  - Vasconcelos AT\r\nFAU - Van Sluys, Marie-Anne\r\nAU  - Van Sluys MA\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Comparative Study\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.\r\nDEP - 20081231\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PLoS One\r\nJT  - PloS one\r\nJID - 101285081\r\nRN  - 9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)\r\nRN  - EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *Evolution, Molecular\r\nMH  - Genes, Bacterial\r\nMH  - Genetic Variation\r\nMH  - Genome, Bacterial/*genetics\r\nMH  - Genome, Viral/*genetics\r\nMH  - Integrases/metabolism\r\nMH  - Microscopy, Electron, Transmission\r\nMH  - Open Reading Frames/genetics\r\nMH  - Phylogeny\r\nMH  - Prophages/*genetics\r\nMH  - RNA, Transfer/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Xylella/classification/*genetics/growth & development\r\nPMC - PMC2605562\r\nCOIS- Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\r\nEDAT- 2009/01/01 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2009/02/14 09:00\r\nPMCR- 2008/12/31\r\nCRDT- 2009/01/01 09:00\r\nPHST- 2008/09/04 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2008/11/07 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2008/12/31 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 08-PONE-RA-06235 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004059 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - PLoS One. 2008;3(12):e4059. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004059.

This study investigates the \r\n      genetic diversity of PvRON2 and the naturally acquired immune response to P. \r\n      vivax isolates. RESULTS: Here, the genetic diversity of PvRON2(1828-2080) and the \r\n      naturally acquired humoral immune response against PvRON2(1828-2080) in infected \r\n      and non-infected individuals from a vivax malaria endemic area in Brazil was \r\n      reported. The diversity analysis of PvRON2(1828-2080) revealed that the protein \r\n      is conserved in isolates in Brazil and worldwide. A total of 18 (19%) patients \r\n      had IgG antibodies to PvRON2(1828-2080). Additionally, the analysis of the \r\n      antibody response in individuals who were not acutely infected with malaria, but \r\n      had been infected with malaria in the past indicated that 32 patients (33%) \r\n      exhibited an IgG immune response against PvRON2. CONCLUSIONS: PvRON2 was \r\n      conserved among the studied isolates. The presence of naturally acquired \r\n      antibodies to this protein in the absence of the disease suggests that PvRON2 \r\n      induces a long-term antibody response. These results indicate that PvRON2 is a \r\n      potential malaria vaccine candidate.\r\nFAU - Bittencourt, Najara C\r\nAU  - Bittencourt NC\r\nAD  - Laboratory of Tropical Diseases-Prof. Dr. Luiz Jacintho da Silva, Department of \r\n      Genetics, Evolution, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, \r\n      Campinas, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU -

20\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00020 [doi]\r\nLID - 20\r\nAB  - Patients infected with the Dengue virus (DENV) often present with a massive \r\n      generation of DENV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the blood. In some \r\n      cases, these ASCs represent more than 50% of the circulating B cells, a higher \r\n      magnitude than those induced by other infections, vaccinations, and plasma cell \r\n      lymphomas. However, it remains unclear how the DENV infection elicits this \r\n      colossal response. To address this issue, we utilised an in vitro strategy to \r\n      induce human PBMCs of healthy individuals incubated with DENV particles (DENV4 \r\n      TVP/360) to differentiate into ASCs. As controls, PBMCs were incubated with a \r\n      mitogen cocktail or supernatants of uninfected C6/36 cells (mock). The ASC \r\n      phenotype and function were increasingly detected in the DENV and \r\n      mitogen-cultured PBMCs as compared to mock-treated cells. In contrast to the in \r\n      vivo condition, secreted IgG derived from the PBMC-DENV culture was not \r\n      DENV-specific. Lower ASC numbers were observed when inactivated viral particles \r\n      or purified B cells were added to the cultures. The physical contact was \r\n      essential between B cells and the remaining PBMCs for the DENV-mediated ASC \r\n      response. Considering the evidence for the activation of the tryptophan \r\n      metabolism detected in the serum of Dengue patients, we assessed its relevance in \r\n      the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation. For this, tryptophan and its respective \r\n      metabolites were quantified in the supernatants of cell cultures through mass \r\n      spectrophotometry. Tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation were found in \r\n      the supernatants of PBMC-DENV cultures, which presented enhanced detection of \r\n      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 transcripts as compared to controls. In \r\n      PBMC-DENV cultures, tryptophan and kynurenine levels strongly correlated to the \r\n      respective ASC numbers, while the kynurenine levels were directly proportional to \r\n      the secreted IgG titers. Contrastingly, PBMCs incubated with Zika or attenuated \r\n      Yellow Fever viruses showed no correlation between their kynurenine \r\n      concentrations and ASC numbers. Therefore, our data revealed the existence of \r\n      distinct pathways for the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation and suggest the \r\n      involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in this cellular process triggered by \r\n      flavivirus infections.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2020 Bonezi, Cataneo, Branquinho, Silva, Gonzalez-Dias, Pereira, \r\n      Ferreira, Nakaya, Campa, Wowk and Silveira.\r\nFAU - Bonezi, Vivian\r\nAU  - Bonezi V\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Cataneo, Allan H D\r\nAU  - Cataneo AHD\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Carlos Chagas (ICC/Fiocruz Paraná), \r\n      Curitiba, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Branquinho, Maryana S F\r\nAU  - Branquinho MSF\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silva, Maysa B B\r\nAU  - Silva MBB\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Gonzalez-Dias, Patricia\r\nAU  - Gonzalez-Dias P\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pereira, Samuel S\r\nAU  - Pereira SS\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Luís C de Souza\r\nAU  - Ferreira LCS\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Campa, Ana\r\nAU  - Campa A\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Wowk, Pryscilla F\r\nAU  - Wowk PF\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Carlos Chagas (ICC/Fiocruz Paraná), \r\n      Curitiba, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Silveira, Eduardo L V\r\nAU  - Silveira ELV\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20200211\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 343-65-7 (Kynurenine)\r\nRN  - 8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology\r\nMH  - Blood Donors\r\nMH  - Cell Differentiation/*immunology\r\nMH  - Cells, Cultured\r\nMH  - Dengue/immunology/*metabolism/virology\r\nMH  - Dengue Virus/*immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Kynurenine/metabolism\r\nMH  - Tryptophan/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Yellow Fever/immunology/*metabolism/virology\r\nMH  - Yellow fever virus/*immunology\r\nMH  - Zika Virus/*immunology\r\nMH  - Zika Virus Infection/immunology/*metabolism/virology\r\nPMC - PMC7026258\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - B cell differentiation\r\nOT  - Dengue virus\r\nOT  - antibody-secreting cells\r\nOT  - flaviviruses\r\nOT  - tryptophan metabolism\r\nEDAT- 2020/03/03 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2021/02/20 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2020/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2020/03/03 06:00\r\nPHST- 2019/10/10 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2020/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00020 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 11;11:20. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00020. eCollection \r\n      2020.\r\n\r\nPMID- 28848230\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20180604\r\nLR  - 20191210\r\nIS  - 2058-5276 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2058-5276 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 2\r\nIP  - 10\r\nDP  - 2017 Oct\r\nTI  - Specific inhibition of NLRP3 in chikungunya disease reveals a role for \r\n      inflammasomes in alphavirus-induced inflammation.\r\nPG  - 1435-1445\r\nLID - 10.1038/s41564-017-0015-4 [doi]\r\nAB  - Mosquito-borne viruses can cause severe inflammatory diseases and there are \r\n      limited therapeutic solutions targeted specifically at virus-induced \r\n      inflammation. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging alphavirus responsible for \r\n      several outbreaks worldwide in the past decade, causes debilitating joint \r\n      inflammation and severe pain. Here, we show that CHIKV infection activates the \r\n      NLRP3 inflammasome in humans and mice. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells \r\n      isolated from CHIKV-infected patients showed elevated NLRP3, caspase-1 and \r\n      interleukin-18 messenger RNA expression and, using a mouse model of CHIKV \r\n      infection, we found that high NLRP3 expression was associated with peak \r\n      inflammatory symptoms. Inhibition of NLRP3 activation using the small-molecule \r\n      inhibitor MCC950 resulted in reduced CHIKV-induced inflammation and abrogated \r\n      osteoclastogenic bone loss and myositis, but did not affect in vivo viral \r\n      replication. Mice treated with MCC950 displayed lower expression levels of the \r\n      cytokines interleukin-6, chemokine ligand 2 and tumour necrosis factor in joint \r\n      tissue. Interestingly, MCC950 treatment abrogated disease signs in mice infected \r\n      with a related arthritogenic alphavirus, Ross River virus, but not in mice \r\n      infected with West Nile virus-a flavivirus. Here, using mouse models of \r\n      alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease, we demonstrate that NLRP3 inhibition \r\n      in vivo can reduce inflammatory pathology and that further development of \r\n      therapeutic solutions targeting inflammasome function could help treat arboviral \r\n      diseases.\r\nFAU -

To overcome these challenges, we have previously \r\n      developed a recombinant BCG strain expressing the detoxified E. coli Heat-Labile \r\n      Toxin (LTAK63), providing increased protection in mouse models and reduced lung \r\n      pathology. Here, using systems biology and RNA sequencing of lung tissues in a \r\n      murine model, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying rBCG-LTAK63's \r\n      increased protection. Immunization triggered early activation of cAMP-related \r\n      pathways, leading to hypoxia, autophagy, and circadian rhythm gene regulation. \r\n      These processes were associated with an enhanced innate immunity and promoted \r\n      long-lasting Th1/Th17 adaptive responses. Upon challenge, mice immunized with \r\n      rBCG-LTAK63 exhibited an earlier onset of interferon-gamma response, reduced \r\n      bacterial burden, and improved lung histopathology. Notably, circadian rhythm \r\n      regulation was directly linked to a controlled inflammatory response and reduced \r\n      migration of infection-susceptible cells, resulting in decreased immunopathology. \r\n      Our findings demonstrate that rBCG-LTAK63 orchestrates protection through the \r\n      integration of metabolic and temporal immune pathways. This work provides \r\n      mechanistic insights into how rational vaccine design can reprogram host immunity \r\n      to enhance protection and reduce pathology, supporting rBCG-LTAK63 as a promising \r\n      next-generation TB vaccine candidate.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Marques-Neto, Trentini, Moreno, Eto, Carvalho, Neto, Amaral, \r\n      Martins, Gonçalves, Chudzinski-Tavassi, Kanno, Tagliabue, Boraschi, \r\n      Verjovski-Almeida, Nakaya, Farias, Ramos and Leite.\r\nFAU - Marques-Neto, Lázaro M\r\nAU  - Marques-Neto LM\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Vacinas, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Trentini, Monalisa M\r\nAU  - Trentini MM\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Vacinas, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Moreno, Ana Carolina R\r\nAU  - Moreno ACR\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Vacinas, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Eto, Silas F\r\nAU  - Eto SF\r\nAD  - Center of Excellence in New Target Discovery (CENTD), Instituto Butantan, São \r\n      Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Carvalho, Ana Carolina O\r\nAU  - Carvalho ACO\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Desenvolvimento de Vacinas, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Neto, Almiro P S\r\nAU  - Neto APS\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Medicina e Saúde Pública de Precisão (MeSP2), Instituto Gonçalo \r\n      Moniz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ-BA), Salvador, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Amaral, Murilo S\r\nAU  - Amaral MS\r\nAD  - Laboratório de Ciclo Celular, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Martins, André G C\r\nAU  - Martins AGC\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences.

Thus, eliciting robust CD8 T-cell immunity is the basis for many vaccines \r\n      under development. However, the relationship between antigen load and the \r\n      magnitude of the CD8 T-cell response is not well-described in a human immune \r\n      response. Here we address this issue by quantifying viral load and the CD8 T-cell \r\n      response in a cohort of 80 individuals immunized with the live attenuated yellow \r\n      fever vaccine (YFV-17D) by sampling peripheral blood at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, \r\n      11, 14, 30, and 90. When the virus load was below a threshold (peak virus load < \r\n      225 genomes per mL, or integrated virus load < 400 genome days per mL), the \r\n      magnitude of the CD8 T-cell response correlated strongly with the virus load \r\n      (R(2) ∼ 0.63). As the virus load increased above this threshold, the magnitude of \r\n      the CD8 T-cell responses saturated. Recent advances in CD8 T-cell-based vaccines \r\n      have focused on replication-incompetent or single-cycle vectors. However, these \r\n      approaches deliver relatively limited amounts of antigen after immunization. Our \r\n      results highlight the requirement that T-cell-based vaccines should deliver \r\n      sufficient antigen during the initial period of the immune response to elicit a \r\n      large number of CD8 T cells that may be needed for protection.\r\nFAU - Akondy, Rama S\r\nAU  - Akondy RS\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Department of Microbiology and Immunology.\r\nFAU - Johnson, Philip L F\r\nAU  - Johnson PL\r\nAD  - Department of Biology and.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and \r\n      Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, 05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Edupuganti, Srilatha\r\nAU  - Edupuganti S\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, \r\n      Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322;\r\nFAU - Mulligan, Mark J\r\nAU  - Mulligan MJ\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, \r\n      Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322;\r\nFAU - Lawson, Benton\r\nAU  - Lawson B\r\nAD  - Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322; \r\n      and.\r\nFAU - Miller, Joseph D\r\nAU  - Miller JD\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center.\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.\r\nFAU - Antia, Rustom\r\nAU  - Antia R\r\nAD  - Department of Biology and rahmed@emory.edu rantia@emory.edu.\r\nFAU - Ahmed, Rafi\r\nAU  - Ahmed R\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, rahmed@emory.edu \r\n      rantia@emory.edu.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R00 GM104158/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01AI110720/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - K99 GM104158/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI110720/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nDEP - 20150223\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\r\nJT  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\r\nJID - 7505876\r\nRN  - 0 (Yellow Fever Vaccine)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology\r\nMH  - Cohort Studies\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Viral Load\r\nMH  - Yellow Fever Vaccine/*immunology\r\nMH  - Yellow fever virus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification\r\nPMC - PMC4364194\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - effector T cells\r\nOT  - human CD8 T cells\r\nOT  - immune memory\r\nOT  - vaccines\r\nOT  - viral load\r\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflict of interest.\r\nEDAT- 2015/02/26 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2015/05/12 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2015/09/10\r\nCRDT- 2015/02/26 06:00\r\nPHST- 2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2015/09/10 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 1500475112 [pii]\r\nAID - 201500475 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1073/pnas.1500475112 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Mar 10;112(10):3050-5. doi: \r\n      10.1073/pnas.1500475112.

Methotrexate (MTX) remains the first-line therapy for RA \r\n      and its anti-inflammatory effect is associated with the maintenance of high \r\n      levels of extracellular adenosine (ADO). Nonetheless, up to 40% of RA patients \r\n      are resistant to MTX treatment and this is linked to a reduction of CD39 \r\n      expression, an ectoenzyme involved in the generation of extracellular ADO by ATP \r\n      metabolism, on circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the mechanism \r\n      mediating the reduction of CD39 expression on Tregs is unknown. Here we \r\n      demonstrated that the impairment in TGF-β signalling lead to the reduction of \r\n      CD39 expression on Tregs that accounts for MTX resistance. TGF-β increases CD39 \r\n      expression on Tregs via the activation of TGFBRII/TGFBRI, SMAD2 and the \r\n      transcription factor CREB, which is activated in a p38-dependent manner and \r\n      induces CD39 expression by promoting ENTPD1 gene transcription. Importantly, \r\n      unresponsive patients to MTX (UR-MTX) show reduced expression of TGFBR2 and CREB1 \r\n      and decreased levels of p-SMAD2 and p-CREB in Tregs compared to MTX-responsive \r\n      patients (R-MTX). Furthermore, RA patients carrying at least one mutant allele \r\n      for rs1431131 (AT or AA) of the TGFBR2 gene are significantly (p = 0.0006) \r\n      associated with UR-MTX. Therefore, we have uncovered a molecular mechanism for \r\n      the reduced CD39 expression on Tregs, and revealed potential targets for \r\n      therapeutic intervention for MTX resistance.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the potential of miR-137 in \r\n      glioblastoma therapy, we conducted genome-wide target mapping in glioblastoma \r\n      cells by measuring the level of association between PABP and mRNAs in cells \r\n      transfected with miR-137 mimics vs. controls via RIPSeq. Impact on mRNA levels \r\n      was also measured by RNASeq. By combining the results of both experimental \r\n      approaches, 1468 genes were found to be negatively impacted by miR-137--among \r\n      them, 595 (40%) contain miR-137 predicted sites. The most relevant targets \r\n      include oncogenic proteins and key players in neurogenesis like c-KIT, YBX1, \r\n      AKT2, CDC42, CDK6 and TGFβ2. Interestingly, we observed that several identified \r\n      miR-137 targets are also predicted to be regulated by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-7, \r\n      which are equally implicated in neuronal differentiation and gliomagenesis. We \r\n      suggest that the concomitant increase of these four miRNAs in neuronal stem cells \r\n      or their repression in tumor cells could produce a robust regulatory effect with \r\n      major consequences to neuronal differentiation and tumorigenesis.\r\nFAU - Tamim, Saleh\r\nAU  - Tamim S\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Vo, Dat T\r\nAU  - Vo DT\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Uren, Philip J\r\nAU  - Uren PJ\r\nAD  - Molecular and Computational Biology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, \r\n      University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of \r\n      America.\r\nFAU - Qiao, Mei\r\nAU  - Qiao M\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Bindewald, Eckart\r\nAU  - Bindewald E\r\nAD  - Basic Science Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Center for Cancer Research \r\n      Nanobiology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, \r\n      Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Kasprzak, Wojciech K\r\nAU  - Kasprzak WK\r\nAD  - Basic Science Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Center for Cancer Research \r\n      Nanobiology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, \r\n      Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Shapiro, Bruce A\r\nAU  - Shapiro BA\r\nAD  - Center for Cancer Research Nanobiology Program, National Cancer Institute, \r\n      Frederick, Maryland, California.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical Analyses and Toxicology, Institute of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Burns, Suzanne C\r\nAU  - Burns SC\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Araujo, Patricia R\r\nAU  - Araujo PR\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Nakano, Ichiro\r\nAU  - Nakano I\r\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio \r\n      State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Radek, Agnes J\r\nAU  - Radek AJ\r\nAD  - Epicentre (An Illumina Company), Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Kuersten, Scott\r\nAU  - Kuersten S\r\nAD  - Epicentre (An Illumina Company), Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.\r\nFAU - Smith, Andrew D\r\nAU  - Smith AD\r\nAD  - Molecular and Computational Biology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, \r\n      University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of \r\n      America.\r\nFAU - Penalva, Luiz O F\r\nAU  - Penalva LO\r\nAD  - Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center \r\n      at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America ;

Here we report that \r\n      infection with acute Armstrong (ARM) or chronic Clone 13 (C13) strains of \r\n      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) led to two distinct phases of innate \r\n      immune response. During the first 72 hr of infection, dendritic cells upregulated \r\n      activation markers and stimulated antiviral CD8(+) T cells, independent of viral \r\n      strain. Seven days after infection, there was an increase in Ly6C(hi) monocytic \r\n      and Gr-1(hi) neutrophilic cells in lymphoid organs and blood. This expansion in \r\n      cell numbers was enhanced and sustained in C13 infection, whereas it occurred \r\n      only transiently with ARM infection. These cells resembled myeloid-derived \r\n      suppressor cells and potently suppressed T cell proliferation. The reduction of \r\n      monocytic cells in Ccr2(-/-) mice or after Gr-1 antibody depletion enhanced \r\n      antiviral T cell function. Thus, innate cells have an important immunomodulatory \r\n      role throughout chronic infection.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Around 50% of melanomas are driven by activating mutations in \r\n      BRAF that has led to the development of potent anti-BRAF inhibitors. However \r\n      resistance to anti-BRAF therapy usually develops within a few months and \r\n      consequently there is a need to identify alternative therapies that will bypass \r\n      BRAF inhibitor resistance. The curcumin analogue DM-1 (sodium \r\n      4-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-3-oxo-penta-1,4-dienyl]-2-methoxy-phenolate) \r\n      has substantial anti-tumor activity in melanoma, but its mechanism of action \r\n      remains unclear. Here we use a synthetic lethal genetic screen in Saccharomyces \r\n      cerevisiae to identify 211 genes implicated in sensitivity to DM-1 toxicity. From \r\n      these 211 genes, 74 had close human orthologues implicated in oxidative \r\n      phosphorylation, insulin signaling and iron and RNA metabolism. Further analysis \r\n      identified 7 target genes (ADK, ATP6V0B, PEMT, TOP1, ZFP36, ZFP36L1, ZFP36L2) \r\n      with differential expression during melanoma progression implicated in regulation \r\n      of tumor progression, cell differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal \r\n      transition. Of these TOP1 and ADK were regulated by DM-1 in treatment-naïve and \r\n      vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells respectively. These data reveal that the \r\n      anticancer effect of curcumin analogues is likely to be mediated via multiple \r\n      targets and identify several genes that represent candidates for combinatorial \r\n      targeting in melanoma.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this \r\n      study is to study the genes and microRNAs expression in tissues and their \r\n      connections in regards to the pathobiological processes. To do so, we integrated \r\n      for the first time global microRNA and mRNA expression profiling from myocardial \r\n      tissue of CCC patients employing pathways and network analyses. We observed an \r\n      enrichment in biological processes and pathways associated with the immune \r\n      response and metabolism. IFNγ, TNF and NFkB were the top upstream regulators. The \r\n      intersections between differentially expressed microRNAs and differentially \r\n      expressed target mRNAs showed an enrichment in biological processes such as \r\n      Inflammation, inflammation, Th1/IFN-γ-inducible genes, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and \r\n      mitochondrial/oxidative stress/antioxidant response. MicroRNAs also played a role \r\n      in the regulation of gene expression involved in the key cardiomyopathy-related \r\n      processes fibrosis, hypertrophy, myocarditis and arrhythmia. Significantly, a \r\n      discrete number of differentially expressed microRNAs targeted a high number of \r\n      differentially expressed mRNAs (>20) in multiple processes. Our results suggest \r\n      that miRNAs orchestrate expression of multiple genes in the major \r\n      pathophysiological processes in CCC heart tissue. This may have a bearing on \r\n      pathogenesis, biomarkers and therapy.\r\nFAU - Laugier, Laurie\r\nAU  - Laugier L\r\nAD  - Aix Marseille Université, Génétique et Immunologie des Maladies Parasitaires, \r\n      Unité Mixte de Recherche S906, Marseille, France; INSERM, U906, Marseille, \r\n      France.\r\nFAU -

In \r\n      particular, it was shown that programmed death-1 (PD-1) regulates T cell \r\n      dysfunction during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice, \r\n      and PD-1(hi) cells exhibit an intense exhausted gene signature. These findings \r\n      were extended to human chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and \r\n      hepatitis B virus. However, it is not known if PD-1(hi) cells of healthy humans \r\n      have the traits of exhausted cells. In this study, we provide a comprehensive \r\n      description of phenotype, function, and gene expression profiles of PD-1(hi) \r\n      versus PD-1(lo) CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy human adults as \r\n      follows: 1) the percentage of naive and memory CD8 T cells varied widely in the \r\n      peripheral blood cells of healthy humans, and PD-1 was expressed by the memory \r\n      CD8 T cells; 2) PD-1(hi) CD8 T cells in healthy humans did not significantly \r\n      correlate with the PD-1(hi) exhausted gene signature of HIV-specific human CD8 T \r\n      cells or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8 T cells from \r\n      mice; 3) PD-1 expression did not directly affect the ability of CD8 T cells to \r\n      secrete cytokines in healthy adults; 4) PD-1 was expressed by the effector memory \r\n      compared with terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells; and 5) finally, an \r\n      interesting inverse relationship between CD45RA and PD-1 expression was observed. \r\n      In conclusion, our study shows that most PD-1(hi) CD8 T cells in healthy adult \r\n      humans are effector memory cells rather than exhausted cells.\r\nFAU - Duraiswamy, Jaikumar\r\nAU  - Duraiswamy J\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.\r\nFAU - Ibegbu, Chris C\r\nAU  - Ibegbu CC\r\nFAU - Masopust, David\r\nAU  - Masopust D\r\nFAU - Miller, Joseph D\r\nAU  - Miller JD\r\nFAU - Araki, Koichi\r\nAU  - Araki K\r\nFAU - Doho, Gregory H\r\nAU  - Doho GH\r\nFAU - Tata, Pramila\r\nAU  - Tata P\r\nFAU - Gupta, Satish\r\nAU  - Gupta S\r\nFAU - Zilliox, Michael J\r\nAU  - Zilliox MJ\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nFAU - Haining, W Nicholas\r\nAU  - Haining WN\r\nFAU - Freeman, Gordon J\r\nAU  - Freeman GJ\r\nFAU - Ahmed, Rafi\r\nAU  - Ahmed R\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE26495\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P01 AI080192/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R01 AI139675/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P01 AI080192-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54 AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Comparative Study\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20110307\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - J Immunol\r\nJT  - Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)\r\nJID - 2985117R\r\nRN  - 0 (Antigens, CD)\r\nRN  - 0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (PDCD1 protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Adult\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology\r\nMH  - Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology\r\nMH  - CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/microbiology\r\nMH  - Down-Regulation/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Profiling/*methods\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Immunologic Memory/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - *Immunophenotyping\r\nMH  - Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - Lymphocyte Count/methods\r\nMH  - Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/immunology\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods\r\nMH  - Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor\r\nMH  - Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism/microbiology\r\nMH  - Up-Regulation/genetics/immunology\r\nPMC - PMC3723805\r\nMID - NIHMS312012\r\nEDAT- 2011/03/09 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2011/06/17 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/07/26\r\nCRDT- 2011/03/09 06:00\r\nPHST- 2011/03/09 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2011/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/07/26 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - jimmunol.1001783 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1001783 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - J Immunol. 2011 Apr 1;186(7):4200-12. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1001783.

Here, we compared at the \r\n      molecular level the extent of individual inflammatory perturbation of plasma \r\n      protein and lipid mediators associated with TB in patients in China versus India. \r\n      We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing the overall degree of inflammatory \r\n      perturbation in treatment-naïve pulmonary TB patients and uninfected individuals \r\n      from India (TB: n = 97, healthy: n = 20) and China (TB: n = 100, healthy: \r\n      n = 11). We employed the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) adapted to plasma \r\n      biomarkers to examine the overall changes in inflammation between these \r\n      countries. M. tuberculosis infection caused a significant degree of molecular \r\n      perturbation in patients from both countries, with higher perturbation detected \r\n      in India. Interestingly, there were differences in biomarker perturbation \r\n      patterns and the overall degree of inflammation. Patients with severe TB \r\n      exhibited increased MDP values and Indian patients with this condition exhibited \r\n      even higher degree of perturbation compared to Chinese patients. Network analyses \r\n      identified IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-1RI and TNF-α as combined biomarkers that account for \r\n      the overall molecular perturbation in the entire study population. Our results \r\n      delineate the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory perturbation in pulmonary TB \r\n      and reveal qualitative changes in inflammatory profiles between two countries \r\n      with high disease prevalence.\r\nFAU -

10.3390/microorganisms13050980 [doi]\r\nLID - 980\r\nAB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) \r\n      amazonensis and L. (Viannia) braziliensis, presents a wide spectrum of clinical \r\n      and immunopathological manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous \r\n      leishmaniasis (LCL) to severe forms like anergic diffuse cutaneous (ADCL) and \r\n      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Despite evidence of the immune response's \r\n      complexity, the role of inflammasomes in disease severity and parasite \r\n      persistence remains unclear. We investigated the transcriptomic and \r\n      immunopathological profiles of inflammasome components in patient lesions across \r\n      the clinical spectrum. Genes such as NLRP3, AIM2, NLRP12, NLRC4, CASP1, CASP5, \r\n      GSDMD, and IL1B and all evaluated proteins, showed higher expression in ACL \r\n      compared to healthy controls. Distinct inflammasome activation patterns were \r\n      observed: MCL, the hyperreactive form, showed elevated NLRP3, AIM2, and IL-1β, \r\n      indicating an intensified inflammatory environment. ADCL, the hyporeactive form, \r\n      displayed increased NLRP12 and NLRC4 expression with reduced GSDMD. Localized \r\n      forms showed transitional profiles, highlighting ACL's multifactorial \r\n      pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms \r\n      in ACL, identifying potential therapeutic targets to modulate inflammation and \r\n      improve management.\r\nFAU - Alcântara, Larissa Dos Santos\r\nAU  -

EEHV-induced haemorrhagic \r\n      disease is a major threat to juvenile Asian elephants. A vaccine preventing \r\n      severe disease and death would support conservation efforts for this endangered \r\n      species. We developed a heterologous, recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara \r\n      prime and adjuvanted protein boost vaccine, containing regulatory protein EE2 and \r\n      major capsid protein. Vaccine design targeted Th1 and cytotoxic T cell responses, \r\n      crucial for herpesvirus immunity. In a proof-of-concept trial, safety and \r\n      immunogenicity were tested in adult elephants. A modified interferon-γ release \r\n      (IFNG) point-of-care vaccine-specific whole blood assay was established to avoid \r\n      sample transport-related loss of immune readouts and determine T cell responses \r\n      by RT-qPCR first. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was utilised to investigate \r\n      transcriptomic changes post-vaccination. No adverse reactions were observed \r\n      following heterologous vaccination. IFNG responses to candidate antigens were \r\n      detected against the pre-existing latent immunity in adult elephants. \r\n      Over-representation analysis revealed induction of T cell-associated pathways. \r\n      Thus, we show that the vaccine has a favourable safety profile and stimulates \r\n      EEHV-specific T cell-biased immune responses, warranting further evaluation.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

10.3390/ijms25115671 [doi]\r\nLID - 5671\r\nAB  - RNA processing is a highly conserved mechanism that serves as a pivotal regulator \r\n      of gene expression. Alternative processing generates transcripts that can still \r\n      be translated but lead to potentially nonfunctional proteins. A plethora of \r\n      respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \r\n      (SARS-CoV-2), strategically manipulate the host's RNA processing machinery to \r\n      circumvent antiviral responses. We integrated publicly available omics datasets \r\n      to systematically analyze isoform-level expression and delineate the nascent \r\n      peptide landscape of SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells. Our findings explore a \r\n      suggested but uncharacterized mechanism, whereby SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the \r\n      predominant expression of unproductive splicing isoforms in key IFN signaling, \r\n      interferon-stimulated (ISGs), class I MHC, and splicing machinery genes, \r\n      including IRF7, HLA-B, and HNRNPH1. In stark contrast, cytokine and chemokine \r\n      genes, such as IL6 and TNF, predominantly express productive (protein-coding) \r\n      splicing isoforms in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We postulate that \r\n      SARS-CoV-2 employs an unreported tactic of exploiting the host splicing machinery \r\n      to bolster viral replication and subvert the immune response by selectively \r\n      upregulating unproductive splicing isoforms from antigen presentation and \r\n      antiviral response genes.

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine \r\n      laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles \r\n      is still unknown. METHODS: A multidimensional analysis was performed involving \r\n      millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178 887 \r\n      individuals from Brazil, of whom 33 266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analyzed \r\n      data included those relating to complete blood cell count, electrolytes, \r\n      metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and \r\n      others. FINDINGS: COVID-19 induced similar alterations in laboratory parameters \r\n      in males and females. CRP and ferritin were increased, especially in older men \r\n      with COVID-19, whereas abnormal liver function tests were common across several \r\n      age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and \r\n      eosinophils were more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female \r\n      COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units displayed alterations in the \r\n      coagulation system, and higher values for neutrophils, CRP, and lactate \r\n      dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the laboratory profiles of a \r\n      large cohort of COVID-19 patients, which formed the basis of discrepancies \r\n      influenced by aging and biological sex.

DNA microarrays representing 2,608 \r\n      (91.6%) coding sequences (CDS) of X. fastidiosa CVC strain 9a5c were used to \r\n      investigate transcript levels during growth with different iron availabilities. \r\n      When treated with the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, 193 CDS were considered \r\n      up-regulated and 216 were considered down-regulated. Upon incubation with 100 \r\n      microM ferric pyrophosphate, 218 and 256 CDS were considered up- and \r\n      down-regulated, respectively. Differential expression for a subset of 44 CDS was \r\n      further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Several CDS involved \r\n      with regulatory functions, pathogenicity, and cell structure were modulated under \r\n      both conditions assayed, suggesting that major changes in cell architecture and \r\n      metabolism occur when X. fastidiosa cells are exposed to extreme variations in \r\n      iron concentration. Interestingly, the modulated CDS include those related to \r\n      colicin V-like bacteriocin synthesis and secretion and to functions of \r\n      pili/fimbriae. We also investigated the contribution of the ferric uptake \r\n      regulator Fur to the iron stimulon of X. fastidiosa. The promoter regions of the \r\n      strain 9a5c genome were screened for putative Fur boxes, and candidates were \r\n      analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, our data \r\n      support the hypothesis that Fur is not solely responsible for the modulation of \r\n      the iron stimulon of X. fastidiosa, and they present novel evidence for iron \r\n      regulation of pathogenicity determinants.\r\nFAU - Zaini, Paulo A\r\nAU  - Zaini PA\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, Av. \r\n      Prof. Lineu Prestes 748, 05508-000, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Fogaça, Andréa C\r\nAU  - Fogaça AC\r\nFAU - Lupo, Fernanda G N\r\nAU  - Lupo FG\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Vêncio, Ricardo Z N\r\nAU  - Vêncio RZ\r\nFAU - da Silva, Aline M\r\nAU  - da Silva AM\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20080125\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - J Bacteriol\r\nJT  - Journal of bacteriology\r\nJID - 2985120R\r\nRN  - 0 (Bacterial Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Bacteriocins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Chelating Agents)\r\nRN  - 0 (Recombinant Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Repressor Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (ferric uptake regulating proteins, bacterial)\r\nRN  - 551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)\r\nRN  - E1UOL152H7 (Iron)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - 2,2'-Dipyridyl/pharmacology\r\nMH  - Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Bacteriocins/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Chelating Agents/pharmacology\r\nMH  - Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay\r\nMH  - Fimbriae, Bacterial/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects/*genetics\r\nMH  - Genes, Bacterial/*genetics/physiology\r\nMH  - Iron/*pharmacology\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nMH  - Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology\r\nMH  - Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Regulon/genetics/physiology\r\nMH  - Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\r\nMH  - Xylella/drug effects/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism\r\nPMC - PMC2293194\r\nEDAT- 2008/01/29 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2008/07/04 09:00\r\nPMCR- 2008/08/01\r\nCRDT- 2008/01/29 09:00\r\nPHST- 2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2008/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - JB.01495-07 [pii]\r\nAID - 1495-07 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1128/JB.01495-07 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(7):2368-78. doi: 10.1128/JB.01495-07.

Using multiplexed nCounter technology to digitally \r\n      quantify 600 human mRNAs in parallel with 14 virus- and 5 bacterium-specific \r\n      RNAs, we characterized viral and bacterial presence in nasopharyngeal aspirates \r\n      (NPA) of 58 children with ARI and determined the corresponding in situ immune \r\n      profiles. NPA contained different groups of organisms and these were classified \r\n      into bacterial (n = 27), viral (n = 5), codetection [containing both viral and \r\n      bacterial transcripts (n = 21), or indeterminate intermediate where microbial \r\n      load is below threshold (n = 5)]. We then identified differentially expressed \r\n      immune transcripts (DEITs) comparing NPAs from symptomatic children vs. healthy \r\n      controls, and comparing children presenting NPAs with detectable microbial load \r\n      vs. indeterminate. We observed a strong innate immune response in NPAs, due to \r\n      the presence of evolutionarily conserved type I Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes \r\n      (ISG), which was correlated with total bacterial and/or viral load. In comparison \r\n      with indeterminate NPAs, adaptive immunity transcripts discriminated among viral, \r\n      bacterial, and codetected microbial profiles. In viral NPAs, B cell transcripts \r\n      were significantly enriched among DEITs, while only type III IFN was correlated \r\n      with viral load. In bacterial NPAs, myeloid cells and coinhibitory transcripts \r\n      were enriched and significantly correlated with bacterial load. In conclusion, \r\n      digital nCounter transcriptomics provide a microbial and immunological in situ \r\n      \"snapshot\" of the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ARI. This enabled \r\n      discrimination among viral, bacterial, codetection, and indeterminate transcripts \r\n      in the samples using non-invasive sampling.\r\nFAU - Fukutani, Kiyoshi F\r\nAU  - Fukutani KF\r\nAD  -

At present, there are no approved adjuvants for mucosal \r\n      vaccines. Among different immunization routes, oral delivery is the natural \r\n      choice because of its ease of administration. However, oral administration has \r\n      two main drawbacks: proteolytic digestion and immune tolerance. METHODS: In this \r\n      study, a systematic in silico screening of putative protease inhibitors (PIs) \r\n      from bacteria to identify novel oral vaccine adjuvants was conducted. Selected \r\n      candidates were then evaluated for their ability to inhibit gastrointestinal \r\n      proteases and to stimulate murine dendritic cells. Finally, promising candidates \r\n      were incorporated as adjuvants into oral vaccine formulations containing model \r\n      (OVA) or real antigens, such as the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and tetanus \r\n      toxoid and tested in in vivo experiments. In addition, a proteomic analysis to \r\n      assess their effects on dendritic cells was performed. RESULTS: This approach led \r\n      to the selection of 11 PIs from human pathogenic bacteria, representing diverse \r\n      families of PIs. These proteins were then expressed in E. coli; five of them \r\n      demonstrated soluble expression and efficient purification. Three candidates \r\n      -Ecotin from Salmonella, APRin from Pseudomonas, and STA (staphostatin A) from \r\n      Staphylococcus aureus- exhibited both protease inhibition and TLR4-independent \r\n      dendritic-cell activation. In vivo studies demonstrated that Ecotin, APRin, and \r\n      STA enhanced immune responses when orally co-administered with OVA, promoting \r\n      T-cell proliferation and antibody production. Further evaluation with real \r\n      antigens, confirmed their adjuvant effect by inducing mucosal and systemic \r\n      immunity. Proteomic analysis of dendritic cells treated with these proteins \r\n      revealed significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, including interferon \r\n      and TNF-signaling, as well as metabolic pathways linked to immune activation. \r\n      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that three protease inhibitors from \r\n      bacteria: Ecotin, APRin, and STA function as novel oral mucosal adjuvants capable \r\n      of modulating immune responses and enhancing antigen immunogenicity.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2025 Coria, Pueblas Castro, Bruno, Nakaya, Pasquevich and Cassataro.\r\nFAU - Coria, Lorena M\r\nAU  - Coria LM\r\nAD  - Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín \r\n      (UNSAM) - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nAD  - Escuela de Bio y Nanotecnología (EByN), Universidad Nacional de San Martín, \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nFAU - Pueblas Castro, Celeste\r\nAU  - Pueblas Castro C\r\nAD  - Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín \r\n      (UNSAM) - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nAD  - Escuela de Bio y Nanotecnología (EByN), Universidad Nacional de San Martín, \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nFAU - Bruno, Laura\r\nAU  - Bruno L\r\nAD  - Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín \r\n      (UNSAM) - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nAD  - Escuela de Bio y Nanotecnología (EByN), Universidad Nacional de San Martín, \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Institut Pasteur de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pasquevich, Karina A\r\nAU  - Pasquevich KA\r\nAD  - Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín \r\n      (UNSAM) - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nAD  - Escuela de Bio y Nanotecnología (EByN), Universidad Nacional de San Martín, \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nFAU - Cassataro, Juliana\r\nAU  - Cassataro J\r\nAD  - Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, Universidad Nacional de San Martín \r\n      (UNSAM) - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nAD  - Escuela de Bio y Nanotecnología (EByN), Universidad Nacional de San Martín, \r\n      Buenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20251021\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nRN  - 0 (Protease Inhibitors)\r\nRN  - 0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)\r\nRN  - 0 (Adjuvants, Vaccine)\r\nRN  - 0 (Bacterial Proteins)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Dendritic Cells/immunology/drug effects\r\nMH  - Administration, Oral\r\nMH  - *Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology/administration & dosage/isolation & \r\n      purification\r\nMH  - *Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Adjuvants, Vaccine/pharmacology/administration & dosage\r\nMH  - Female\r\nMH  - *Bacteria/immunology\r\nMH  - Immunity, Mucosal\r\nMH  - *Bacterial Proteins/pharmacology\r\nPMC - PMC12620975\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - antigen degradation\r\nOT  - mucosal adjuvant\r\nOT  - mucosal immunity\r\nOT  - oral delivery\r\nOT  - protease inhibitor\r\nCOIS- LC, KP, and JC are inventors of patents related to protease inhibitors used in \r\n      this work: “Adjuvant for vaccines, vaccines that comprise it and uses thereof” \r\n      PCT/ES2010/07066 and “Immunomodulating and immunostimulating polypeptides for \r\n      drug delivery” PCT/IB2019/051026.

To illuminate its molecular underpinnings, we \r\n      employed a genome-driven integrative systems neuroimmunology approach to analyze \r\n      transcriptomic profiles from 3114 individuals (1877 MDD patients and 1237 \r\n      controls). This analysis uncovered coordinated neuroimmune transcriptomic shifts, \r\n      marked by altered expression of genes involved in innate immune regulation, \r\n      suppression of inflammatory responses, and pathways related to sensory \r\n      perception, visual system development, and synaptic signaling. These alterations \r\n      were consistently observed in both peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and brain \r\n      regions implicated in MDD. Among 31 genes jointly dysregulated in blood and \r\n      brain, four stood out as robust predictors of MDD in PBLs: NEGR1, PPP6C, SORCS3, \r\n      and PAX6. Of these, PAX6, a gene previously linked to MDD by GWAS, also exhibited \r\n      differential expression in the amygdala and was functionally enriched in pathways \r\n      governing immune modulation, vesicle trafficking, and neurodevelopmental \r\n      processes, such as neuronal fate determination. In contrast, NEGR1, PPP6C, and \r\n      SORCS3 showed no significant changes in brain expression, suggesting a \r\n      predominantly peripheral role. Importantly, these transcriptomic insights were \r\n      reinforced in a murine model of chronic stress, where immunophenotyping revealed \r\n      elevated PAX6 expression in peripheral myeloid cells. Together, these findings \r\n      reveal a shared neuroimmune signature across the brain and immune system in MDD, \r\n      highlighting PAX6 as a promising mechanistic link and potential biomarker for \r\n      this disorder.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

10.1128/JVI.01844-16 [doi]\r\nLID - e01844-16\r\nAB  - Our previous work has shown that antigens adjuvanted with ligands specific for \r\n      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR7/8 encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic) \r\n      acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) induce robust and durable immune responses \r\n      in mice and macaques. We investigated the efficacy of these NP adjuvants in \r\n      inducing protective immunity against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Rhesus \r\n      macaques (RMs) were immunized with NPs containing TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists mixed \r\n      with soluble recombinant SIVmac239-derived envelope (Env) gp140 and Gag p55 \r\n      (protein) or with virus-like particles (VLPs) containing SIVmac239 Env and Gag. \r\n      NP-adjuvanted vaccines induced robust innate responses, antigen-specific antibody \r\n      responses of a greater magnitude and persistence, and enhanced plasmablast \r\n      responses compared to those achieved with alum-adjuvanted vaccines. NP-adjuvanted \r\n      vaccines induced antigen-specific, long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which \r\n      persisted in the bone marrow for several months after vaccination. NP-adjuvanted \r\n      vaccines induced immune responses that were associated with enhanced protection \r\n      against repeated low-dose, intravaginal challenges with heterologous SIVsmE660 in \r\n      animals that carried TRIM5α restrictive alleles. The protection induced by \r\n      immunization with protein-NP correlated with the prechallenge titers of \r\n      Env-specific IgG antibodies in serum and vaginal secretions. However, no such \r\n      correlate was apparent for immunization with VLP-NP or alum as the adjuvant. \r\n      Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated within \r\n      the first few hours to days after primary vaccination revealed that NP-adjuvanted \r\n      vaccines induced a molecular signature similar to that induced by the live \r\n      attenuated yellow fever viral vaccine. This systems approach identified early \r\n      blood transcriptional signatures that correlate with Env-specific antibody \r\n      responses in vaginal secretions and protection against infection. These results \r\n      demonstrate the adjuvanticity of the NP adjuvant in inducing persistent and \r\n      protective antibody responses against SIV in RMs with implications for the design \r\n      of vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). IMPORTANCE: The results \r\n      of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial, which demonstrated a rapid waning of protective \r\n      immunity with time, have underscored the need to develop strategies to enhance \r\n      the durability of protective immune responses. Our recent work in mice has \r\n      highlighted the capacity of nanoparticle-encapsulated TLR ligands (NP) to induce \r\n      potent and durable antibody responses that last a lifetime in mice. In the \r\n      present study, we evaluated the ability of these NP adjuvants to promote robust \r\n      and durable protective immune responses against SIV in nonhuman primates. Our \r\n      results demonstrate that immunization of rhesus macaques with NP adjuvants mixed \r\n      with soluble SIV Env or a virus-like particle form of Env (VLP) induces potent \r\n      and durable Env-specific antibody responses in the serum and in vaginal \r\n      secretions. These responses were superior to those induced by alum adjuvant, and \r\n      they resulted in enhanced protection against a low-dose intravaginal challenge \r\n      with a heterologous strain of SIV in animals with TRIM5a restrictive alleles. \r\n      These results highlight the potential for such NP TLR L adjuvants in promoting \r\n      robust and durable antibody responses against HIV in the next generation of HIV \r\n      immunogens currently being developed.\r\nCI  -

RASSF1A expression is regulated \r\n      through epigenetic events involving the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2); \r\n      however, the molecular mechanisms modulating the recruitment of this epigenetic \r\n      modifier to the RASSF1 locus remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and \r\n      characterize ANRASSF1, an endogenous unspliced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that \r\n      is transcribed from the opposite strand on the RASSF1 gene locus in several cell \r\n      lines and tissues and binds PRC2. ANRASSF1 is transcribed through RNA polymerase \r\n      II and is 5'-capped and polyadenylated; it exhibits nuclear localization and has \r\n      a shorter half-life compared with other lncRNAs that bind PRC2. ANRASSF1 \r\n      endogenous expression is higher in breast and prostate tumor cell lines compared \r\n      with non-tumor, and an opposite pattern is observed for RASSF1A. ANRASSF1 ectopic \r\n      overexpression reduces RASSF1A abundance and increases the proliferation of HeLa \r\n      cells, whereas ANRASSF1 silencing causes the opposite effects. These changes in \r\n      ANRASSF1 levels do not affect the RASSF1C isoform abundance. ANRASSF1 \r\n      overexpression causes a marked increase in both PRC2 occupancy and histone \r\n      H3K27me3 repressive marks, specifically at the RASSF1A promoter region. No effect \r\n      of ANRASSF1 overexpression was detected on PRC2 occupancy and histone H3K27me3 at \r\n      the promoter regions of RASSF1C and the four other neighboring genes, including \r\n      two well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, we demonstrated that \r\n      ANRASSF1 forms an RNA/DNA hybrid and recruits PRC2 to the RASSF1A promoter. \r\n      Together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism of epigenetic repression of \r\n      the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene involving antisense unspliced lncRNA, in which \r\n      ANRASSF1 selectively represses the expression of the RASSF1 isoform overlapping \r\n      the antisense transcript in a location-specific manner. In a broader perspective, \r\n      our findings suggest that other non-characterized unspliced intronic lncRNAs \r\n      transcribed in the human genome might contribute to a location-specific \r\n      epigenetic modulation of genes.\r\nFAU - Beckedorff, Felipe C\r\nAU  - Beckedorff FC\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil.\r\nFAU - Ayupe, Ana C\r\nAU  - Ayupe AC\r\nFAU - Crocci-Souza, Renan\r\nAU  - Crocci-Souza R\r\nFAU - Amaral, Murilo S\r\nAU  - Amaral MS\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Soltys, Daniela T\r\nAU  - Soltys DT\r\nFAU - Menck, Carlos F M\r\nAU  - Menck CF\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nDEP - 20130822\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - PLoS Genet\r\nJT  - PLoS genetics\r\nJID - 101239074\r\nRN  - 0 (Histones)\r\nRN  - 0 (RASSF1 protein, human)\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)\r\nRN  - 0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)\r\nRN  - EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *Cell Proliferation\r\nMH  - CpG Islands\r\nMH  - DNA Methylation/genetics\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic\r\nMH  - Gene Silencing\r\nMH  - HeLa Cells\r\nMH  - Histones/genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Introns/genetics\r\nMH  - Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism\r\nMH  - Promoter Regions, Genetic\r\nMH  - RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism\r\nPMC - PMC3749938\r\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\r\nEDAT- 2013/08/31 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2014/03/22 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/08/01\r\nCRDT- 2013/08/31 06:00\r\nPHST- 2012/08/14 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - PGENETICS-D-12-02066 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003705 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - PLoS Genet. 2013;9(8):e1003705. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003705.

RESULTS: A survey of mRNA and EST public databases revealed more than \r\n      55,000 totally intronic noncoding (TIN) RNAs transcribed from the introns of 74% \r\n      of all unique RefSeq genes. Guided by this information, we designed an oligoarray \r\n      platform containing sense and antisense probes for each of 7,135 randomly \r\n      selected TIN transcripts plus the corresponding protein-coding genes. We \r\n      identified exonic and intronic tissue-specific expression signatures for human \r\n      liver, prostate and kidney. The most highly expressed antisense TIN RNAs were \r\n      transcribed from introns of protein-coding genes significantly enriched (p = \r\n      0.002 to 0.022) in the 'Regulation of transcription' Gene Ontology category. RNA \r\n      polymerase II inhibition resulted in increased expression of a fraction of \r\n      intronic RNAs in cell cultures, suggesting that other RNA polymerases may be \r\n      involved in their biosynthesis. Members of a subset of intronic and \r\n      protein-coding signatures transcribed from the same genomic loci have correlated \r\n      expression patterns, suggesting that intronic RNAs regulate the abundance or the \r\n      pattern of exon usage in protein-coding messages. CONCLUSION: We have identified \r\n      diverse intronic RNA expression patterns, pointing to distinct regulatory roles. \r\n      This gene-oriented approach, using a combined intron-exon oligoarray, should \r\n      permit further comparative analysis of intronic transcription under various \r\n      physiological and pathological conditions, thus advancing current knowledge about \r\n      the biological functions of these noncoding RNAs.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de São Paulo, São \r\n      Paulo, SP, Brazil. hnakaya@iq.usp.br\r\nFAU - Amaral, Paulo P\r\nAU  - Amaral PP\r\nFAU - Louro, Rodrigo\r\nAU  - Louro R\r\nFAU - Lopes, André\r\nAU  - Lopes A\r\nFAU - Fachel, Angela A\r\nAU  - Fachel AA\r\nFAU - Moreira, Yuri B\r\nAU  - Moreira YB\r\nFAU - El-Jundi, Tarik A\r\nAU  - El-Jundi TA\r\nFAU - da Silva, Aline M\r\nAU  - da Silva AM\r\nFAU - Reis, Eduardo M\r\nAU  - Reis EM\r\nFAU - Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio\r\nAU  - Verjovski-Almeida S\r\nLA  - eng\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE5452\r\nSI  - GEO/GSE5453\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPL  - England\r\nTA  - Genome Biol\r\nJT  - Genome biology\r\nJID - 100960660\r\nRN  - 0 (RNA, Untranslated)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics\r\nMH  - Genes\r\nMH  - *Genome, Human\r\nMH  - Genomics/*methods\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - *Introns\r\nMH  - *RNA, Untranslated\r\nMH  - Tissue Distribution\r\nMH  - Transcription, Genetic\r\nPMC - PMC1868932\r\nEDAT- 2007/03/28 09:00\r\nMHDA- 2007/06/15 09:00\r\nPMCR- 2007/03/26\r\nCRDT- 2007/03/28 09:00\r\nPHST- 2006/10/17 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2007/01/17 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2007/03/26 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2007/03/26 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - gb-2007-8-3-r43 [pii]\r\nAID - 10.1186/gb-2007-8-3-r43 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Genome Biol. 2007;8(3):R43. doi: 10.1186/gb-2007-8-3-r43.\r\n\r\nPMID- 22833339\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20130110\r\nLR  - 20211021\r\nIS  - 1529-0131 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 0004-3591 (Print)\r\nIS  - 0004-3591 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 64\r\nIP  - 11\r\nDP  - 2012 Nov\r\nTI  - Gene profiling of Chikungunya virus arthritis in a mouse model reveals \r\n      significant overlap with rheumatoid arthritis.\r\nPG  - 3553-63\r\nLID - 10.1002/art.34631 [doi]\r\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes a \r\n      chronic debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, for which current treatments \r\n      are often inadequate. To assess whether new drugs being developed for rheumatoid \r\n      arthritis (RA) might find utility in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides, we \r\n      sought to determine whether the inflammatory gene expression signature of CHIKV \r\n      arthritis shows any similarities with RA or collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a \r\n      mouse model of RA. METHODS: Using a recently developed animal model of CHIKV \r\n      arthritis in adult wild-type mice, we generated a consensus CHIKV arthritis gene \r\n      expression signature, which was used to interrogate publicly available microarray \r\n      studies of RA and CIA. Pathway analyses were then performed using the overlapping \r\n      gene signatures. RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis showed that there was a \r\n      highly significant overlap in the differentially expressed genes in the CHIKV \r\n      arthritis model and in RA. This concordance also increased with the severity of \r\n      RA, as measured by the inflammation score. A highly significant overlap was also \r\n      seen between CHIKV arthritis and CIA. Pathway analysis revealed that the overlap \r\n      between these arthritides was spread over a range of different inflammatory \r\n      processes. Involvement of T cells and interferon-γ (IFNγ) in CHIKV arthritis was \r\n      confirmed in studies of MHCII-deficient mice and IFNγ-deficient mice, \r\n      respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that RA, a chronic autoimmune \r\n      arthritis, and CHIKV disease, usually a self-limiting viral arthropathy, share \r\n      multiple inflammatory processes. New drugs and biologic therapies being developed \r\n      for RA may thus find application in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides.\r\nCI  - Copyright © 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - Emory Vaccine Center at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, \r\n      Georgia, USA.\r\nFAU - Gardner, Joy\r\nAU  - Gardner J\r\nFAU - Poo, Yee-Suan\r\nAU  - Poo YS\r\nFAU - Major, Lee\r\nAU  - Major L\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nFAU - Suhrbier, Andreas\r\nAU  - Suhrbier A\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P51 RR000165/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Arthritis Rheum\r\nJT  - Arthritis and rheumatism\r\nJID - 0370605\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - *Alphavirus Infections/complications/genetics/immunology\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - *Arthritis, Infectious/genetics/immunology/virology\r\nMH  - *Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/immunology/virology\r\nMH  - Asia\r\nMH  - Chikungunya Fever\r\nMH  - Chikungunya virus/*immunology\r\nMH  - Disease Models, Animal\r\nMH  - Gene Regulatory Networks/immunology\r\nMH  - Humans\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\r\nMH  - Mice, Knockout\r\nMH  - Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\r\nMH  - Reunion\r\nMH  - Synovial Membrane/immunology\r\nMH  - Transcriptome/*immunology\r\nPMC - PMC3836361\r\nMID - NIHMS454208\r\nEDAT- 2012/07/27 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2013/01/11 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/11/21\r\nCRDT- 2012/07/27 06:00\r\nPHST- 2012/07/27 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2012/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/11/21 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1002/art.34631 [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Arthritis Rheum. 2012 Nov;64(11):3553-63. doi: 10.1002/art.34631.\r\n\r\nPMID- 34556875\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20211005\r\nLR  - 20220112\r\nIS  - 1529-2916 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1529-2908 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 22\r\nIP  - 10\r\nDP  - 2021 Oct\r\nTI  - Hidden in plain sight: uncovering the role of CREB1 in HIV-1 vaccine-induced \r\n      immunity.\r\nPG  - 1199-1200\r\nLID - 10.1038/s41590-021-01018-9 [doi]\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5297-9108\r\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical \r\n      Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. helder.nakaya@einstein.br.\r\nAD  - Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. \r\n      helder.nakaya@einstein.br.\r\nAD  - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil. helder.nakaya@einstein.br.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Comment\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Nat Immunol\r\nJT  - Nature immunology\r\nJID - 100941354\r\nRN  - 0 (Vaccines)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nCON - Nat Immunol. 2021 Oct;22(10):1294-1305. doi: 10.1038/s41590-021-01026-9.

We aimed to assess \r\n      antibody persistence at 1 and 2 years in volunteers who received single-dose \r\n      rVSV-ZEBOV in three previous trials. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, \r\n      we prospectively followed-up participants from the African and European phase 1 \r\n      rVSV-ZEBOV trials, who were vaccinated once in 2014-15 with 300 000 (low dose) or \r\n      10-50 million (high dose) plaque-forming units (pfu) of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to \r\n      assess ZEBOV glycoprotein (IgG) antibody persistence. The primary outcome was \r\n      ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) measured \r\n      yearly by ELISA compared with 1 month (ie, 28 days) after immunisation. We report \r\n      GMCs up to 2 years (Geneva, Switzerland, including neutralising antibodies up to \r\n      6 months) and 1 year (Lambaréné, Gabon; Kilifi, Kenya) after vaccination and \r\n      factors associated with higher antibody persistence beyond 6 months, according to \r\n      multivariable analyses. Trials and the observational study were registered at \r\n      ClinicalTrials.gov (Geneva: NCT02287480 and NCT02933931; Kilifi: NCT02296983) and \r\n      the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry (Lambaréné PACTR201411000919191). \r\n      FINDINGS: Of 217 vaccinees from the original studies (102 from the Geneva study, \r\n      75 from the Lambaréné study, and 40 from the Kilifi study), 197 returned and \r\n      provided samples at 1 year (95 from the Geneva study, 63 from the Lambaréné, and \r\n      39 from the Kilifi study) and 90 at 2 years (all from the Geneva study). In the \r\n      Geneva group, 44 (100%) of 44 participants who had been given a high dose (ie, \r\n      10-50 million pfu) of vaccine and who were seropositive at day 28 remained \r\n      seropositive at 2 years, whereas 33 (89%) of 37 who had been given the low dose \r\n      (ie, 300 000 pfu) remained seropositive for 2 years (p=0·042). In participants \r\n      who had received a high dose, ZEBOV glycoprotein IgG GMCs decreased significantly \r\n      between their peak (at 1-3 months) and month 6 after vaccination in Geneva \r\n      (p<0·0001) and Lambaréné (p=0·0298) but not in Kilifi (p=0·5833) and subsequently \r\n      remained stable at all sites apart from Geneva, where GMC in those given a high \r\n      dose of vaccine increased significantly between 6 months and 1 year (p=0·0264). \r\n      Antibody persistence was similar at 1 year and at 6 months in those who had \r\n      received a low dose of vaccine, with lower titres among participants from the \r\n      Geneva study at 2 years than at 1 year after vaccination (GMC ratio 0·61, 95% CI \r\n      0·49-0·77; p<0·0001). In multivariable analyses, predictors of increased IgG GMCs \r\n      beyond 6 months included high-dose versus low-dose vaccination (Geneva p=0·0133; \r\n      Lambaréné p=0·008) and vaccine-related arthritis (p=0·0176), but not sex, age, or \r\n      baseline seropositivity (all p>0·05). Neutralising antibodies seem to be less \r\n      durable, with seropositivity dropping from 64-71% at 28 days to 27-31% at 6 \r\n      months in participants from the Geneva study.

Neuroinflammation is \r\n      increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to DS neuropathology, although \r\n      its underlying drivers remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed \r\n      available single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data from postmortem cortical \r\n      brains of individuals with DS and controls aged 36 years or younger, focusing \r\n      specifically on astrocyte-enriched clusters. This analysis revealed significant \r\n      alterations in complement system gene sets. To further investigate these \r\n      findings, we employed a human in vitro model using astrocytes differentiated from \r\n      urine-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from individuals \r\n      with DS (T21-iPSCs). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate both \r\n      gene expression and protein levels of secreted complement components in \r\n      T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes. RESULTS: snRNAseq re-analyzes identified an \r\n      upregulation of complement system components, including C1R, C1S, C2, C4A, C4B, \r\n      C5, C5AR1, C6, C8, CD59, CFI, and FCN2, and of glutamate transporters SLC1A3 \r\n      (EAAT1/GLAST-1) and SLC1A2 (EAAT2/GLT-1) in DS astrocytes. Results from the in \r\n      vitro model revealed distinct phenotypic changes in T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes, \r\n      including enlarged cell and nuclear sizes, and enhanced glutamate uptake. \r\n      Elevated levels of C5aR1 and MASP1 transcripts, as well as increased C4 protein \r\n      secretion in culture supernatants, suggest dysregulation of the complement system \r\n      in DS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential contribution of \r\n      astrocyte-driven complement signaling to DS neuropathogenesis. While further \r\n      validation is needed, this work points to a candidate pathway that may serve as a \r\n      target for future therapeutic investigation to improve the quality of life for \r\n      individuals with DS.\r\nCI  - © 2025.

Pathogens have developed strategies to subvert TLRs in \r\n      order to survive and replicate within the host. The model intracellular pathogen, \r\n      Francisella novicida, modulates host defences to promote survival and replication \r\n      in macrophages. TLR2, which recognizes bacterial lipoproteins (BLPs), is critical \r\n      for activating host defences and proinflammatory cytokine production in response \r\n      to Francisella infection. Here we show that the F. novicida protein FTN_0757 acts \r\n      to repress BLP production, dampening TLR2 activation. The ΔFTN_0757 mutant strain \r\n      induced robust TLR2-dependent cytokine production in macrophages compared with \r\n      wild-type bacteria, and produced increased amounts of BLPs. The deletion of one \r\n      BLP (FTN_1103) from ΔFTN_0757 decreased the total BLP concentration to near \r\n      wild-type level sand correlated with a decrease in the inductionof TLR2 \r\n      signalling. The overproduction of BLPs also contributed to the in vivo \r\n      attenuation of the ΔFTN_0757 mutant, which was significantly rescued when \r\n      FTN_1103 was deleted. Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of \r\n      immune evasion by the downregulation of BLP expression to subvert TLR2 \r\n      activation, which is likely used by numerous other intracellular bacterial \r\n      pathogens.\r\nCI  - © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\r\nFAU - Jones, Crystal L\r\nAU  - Jones CL\r\nAD  - Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics \r\n      Program, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.\r\nFAU - Sampson, Timothy R\r\nAU  - Sampson TR\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nFAU - Pulendran, Bali\r\nAU  - Pulendran B\r\nFAU - Weiss, David S\r\nAU  - Weiss DS\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - P30NS055077/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 EY08126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - R56 AI087673/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - G20 RR030956/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 EY008126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 DK58404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - U54 AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States\r\nGR  - P30 NS055077/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\r\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\r\nPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.\r\nDEP - 20120612\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Cell Microbiol\r\nJT  - Cellular microbiology\r\nJID - 100883691\r\nRN  - 0 (Cytokines)\r\nRN  - 0 (Lipoproteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Repressor Proteins)\r\nRN  - 0 (Tlr2 protein, mouse)\r\nRN  - 0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)\r\nSB  - IM\r\nMH  - Animals\r\nMH  - Cells, Cultured\r\nMH  - Cytokines/metabolism\r\nMH  - Francisella tularensis/genetics/*immunology/*pathogenicity\r\nMH  - Gene Deletion\r\nMH  - *Immune Evasion\r\nMH  - Lipoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics\r\nMH  - Macrophages/*immunology/*microbiology\r\nMH  - Mice\r\nMH  - Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism\r\nMH  - Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism\r\nMH  - Virulence\r\nPMC - PMC3443312\r\nMID - NIHMS379856\r\nEDAT- 2012/05/29 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2013/01/29 06:00\r\nPMCR- 2013/10/01\r\nCRDT- 2012/05/29 06:00\r\nPHST- 2012/02/27 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2012/05/04 00:00 [revised]\r\nPHST- 2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2013/01/29 06:00 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2013/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2012.01816.x [doi]\r\nPST - ppublish\r\nSO  - Cell Microbiol. 2012 Oct;14(10):1531-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2012.01816.x. \r\n      Epub 2012 Jun 12.\r\n\r\nPMID- 29075261\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\r\nLR  - 20250530\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Print)\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 1664-3224 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 8\r\nDP  - 2017\r\nTI  - Induction of Cell Cycle and NK Cell Responses by Live-Attenuated Oral Vaccines \r\n      against Typhoid Fever.\r\nPG  - 1276\r\nLID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01276 [doi]\r\nLID - 1276\r\nAB  - The mechanisms by which oral, live-attenuated vaccines protect against typhoid \r\n      fever are poorly understood. Here, we analyze transcriptional responses after \r\n      vaccination with Ty21a or vaccine candidate, M01ZH09. Alterations in response \r\n      profiles were related to vaccine-induced immune responses and subsequent outcome \r\n      after wild-type Salmonella Typhi challenge. Despite broad genetic similarity, we \r\n      detected differences in transcriptional responses to each vaccine. Seven days \r\n      after M01ZH09 vaccination, marked cell cycle activation was identified and \r\n      associated with humoral immunogenicity. By contrast, vaccination with Ty21a was \r\n      associated with NK cell activity and validated in peripheral blood mononuclear \r\n      cell stimulation assays confirming superior induction of an NK cell response. \r\n      Moreover, transcriptional signatures of amino acid metabolism in Ty21a recipients \r\n      were associated with protection against infection, including increased incubation \r\n      time and decreased severity. Our data provide detailed insight into molecular \r\n      immune responses to typhoid vaccines, which could aid the rational design of \r\n      improved oral, live-attenuated vaccines against enteric pathogens.\r\nFAU - Blohmke, Christoph J\r\nAU  - Blohmke CJ\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Hill, Jennifer\r\nAU  - Hill J\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Darton, Thomas C\r\nAU  - Darton TC\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nAD  - Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of \r\n      Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Carvalho-Burger, Matheus\r\nAU  - Carvalho-Burger M\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Eustace, Andrew\r\nAU  - Eustace A\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Jones, Claire\r\nAU  - Jones C\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Schreiber, Fernanda\r\nAU  - Schreiber F\r\nAD  - Microbial Pathogenesis Group, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, \r\n      United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Goodier, Martin R\r\nAU  - Goodier MR\r\nAD  - Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Department of Immunology and \r\n      Infection, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Dougan, Gordon\r\nAU  - Dougan G\r\nAD  - Microbial Pathogenesis Group, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, \r\n      United Kingdom.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder I\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Pollard, Andrew J\r\nAU  - Pollard AJ\r\nAD  - Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, NIHR \r\n      Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nGR  - 092661/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom\r\nGR  - MR/M02637X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nDEP - 20171012\r\nPL  - Switzerland\r\nTA  - Front Immunol\r\nJT  - Frontiers in immunology\r\nJID - 101560960\r\nPMC - PMC5643418\r\nOTO - NOTNLM\r\nOT  - NK cell\r\nOT  - Ty21a\r\nOT  - cell cycle regulation\r\nOT  - functional genomics\r\nOT  - typhoid\r\nOT  - typhoid vaccines\r\nOT  - vaccine immunity\r\nEDAT- 2017/10/28 06:00\r\nMHDA- 2017/10/28 06:01\r\nPMCR- 2017/01/01\r\nCRDT- 2017/10/28 06:00\r\nPHST- 2017/08/01 00:00 [received]\r\nPHST- 2017/09/25 00:00 [accepted]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]\r\nPHST- 2017/10/28 06:01 [medline]\r\nPHST- 2017/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]\r\nAID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01276 [doi]\r\nPST - epublish\r\nSO  - Front Immunol. 2017 Oct 12;8:1276. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01276. eCollection \r\n      2017.\r\n\r\nPMID- 29758668\r\nOWN - NLM\r\nSTAT- MEDLINE\r\nDCOM- 20181008\r\nLR  - 20181008\r\nIS  - 2470-0053 (Electronic)\r\nIS  - 2470-0045 (Linking)\r\nVI  - 97\r\nIP  - 4-1\r\nDP  - 2018 Apr\r\nTI  - Gene regulatory and signaling networks exhibit distinct topological distributions \r\n      of motifs.\r\nPG  - 042417\r\nLID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.97.042417 [doi]\r\nAB  - The biological processes of cellular decision making and differentiation involve \r\n      a plethora of signaling pathways and gene regulatory circuits. These networks in \r\n      turn exhibit a multitude of motifs playing crucial parts in regulating network \r\n      activity. Here we compare the topological placement of motifs in gene regulatory \r\n      and signaling networks and observe that it suggests different evolutionary \r\n      strategies in motif distribution for distinct cellular subnetworks.\r\nFAU - Ferreira, Gustavo Rodrigues\r\nAU  - Ferreira GR\r\nAD  - São Carlos Institute of Physics, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Nakaya, Helder Imoto\r\nAU  - Nakaya HI\r\nAD  - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.\r\nFAU - Costa, Luciano da Fontoura\r\nAU  - Costa LDF\r\nAD  - São Carlos Institute of Physics, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil.\r\nLA  - eng\r\nPT  - Journal Article\r\nPL  - United States\r\nTA  - Phys Rev E\r\nJT  - Physical review.
