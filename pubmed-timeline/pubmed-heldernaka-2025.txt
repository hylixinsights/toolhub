AB  - Identifying conserved, immunogenic proteins that confer protection against 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) colonization could enable development of 
      serotype-independent vaccines. In our controlled human infection model, no 
      individual IgG or cytokine/chemokine response correlated significantly with 
      protection against colonization with pneumococcus, suggesting that effective 
      immunity reflects a coordinated, multi-antigen response. To capture these complex 
      patterns, we trained independent Random Forest models on humoral and cellular 
      datasets. The humoral model identified IgG responses to PdB, SP1069, and SP0899 
      as predictive of protection. The cellular model revealed that MCP-1 responses to 
      SP1069 and SP0899, and IL-17A production in response to SP0648-3, were associated 
      with protection. Elevated baseline IFN-γ, RANTES, and anti-protein IgG levels 
      were linked to reduced colonization density. We highlight SP1069 and SP0899 as 
      potential serotype-independent vaccine candidates and demonstrate the utility of 
      machine learning to identify immune correlates of protection.

TI  - Immune profiling in a living human recipient of a gene-edited pig kidney.
PG  - 270-280
LID - 10.1038/s41591-025-04053-3 [doi]
AB  - Xenotransplantation of gene-edited pig kidneys offers a promising solution to the 
      shortage of kidneys for organ transplantation. We recently performed a 
      gene-edited pig kidney transplantation into a living human recipient with 
      end-stage kidney disease. Here, using transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
      and multiplexed imaging, we conducted high-dimensional immune profiling in this 
      individual. Despite profound depletion of circulating T cells, early T 
      cell-mediated rejection occurred within 1 week after transplantation, likely 
      driven by subtherapeutic immunosuppression and the presence of residual CD8(+) T 
      cells in lymph nodes. This T cell-mediated rejection event was reversed by 
      intensified immunosuppression. After treatment, adaptive immunity remained 
      suppressed, whereas innate immune activation, characterized by sustained monocyte 
      and macrophage activity along with elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta and 
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, persisted. Comparative 
      transcriptomic analysis showed that xenograft rejection profiles resembled those 
      typically observed in human allograft rejection, while also revealing unique 
      innate immune signatures. We did not detect antibody-mediated rejection. The 
      levels of circulating pig donor-derived cell-free DNA rose during the initial 
      rejection episode and declined with treatment, supporting the potential of 
      cell-free DNA measurements as a noninvasive biomarker of xenograft rejection. 
      These findings define the distinct immune landscape of kidney xenotransplantation 
      and highlight the need for regimens targeting both innate and adaptive immunity 
      to improve outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative tool in cell biology, 
      driving discoveries through the analysis of complex biological data. This review 
      explores the diverse applications of AI, including its impact on microscopy, 
      imaging, drug discovery, and synthetic biology. AI methods have significantly 
      advanced our ability to analyze cellular images at single-cell resolution, 
      uncover complex patterns in biological data, and predict cellular responses to 
      various stimuli. Deep learning approaches have improved cell segmentation and 
      tracking, facilitated precise single-cell transcriptomics analysis, and enhanced 
      our understanding of protein structures and interactions. The application of AI 
      to high-throughput technologies has also enabled detailed modeling of cell 
      behavior. Key challenges are addressed, such as data quality requirements, model 
      interpretability, and the need to democratize AI tools for broader accessibility 
      in biology. Finally, the review considers future directions, highlighting AI's 
      potential to advance basic research and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Trisomy 21 increases the risk of severe outcomes and mortality in hospitalized 
      individuals with Down syndrome (DS) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using data 
      from the Brazilian Epidemiological Surveillance Information System Influenza 
      (SIVEP-Gripe), we analyzed 102,767 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (1,115 DS and 
      101,652 non-DS, NDS). DS patients had a higher prevalence of comorbidities and 
      required ventilatory support, ICU admission, and intubation more frequently than 
      NDS patients (p < 0.001). Mortality was 4.5 times higher in DS patients aged 0-30 
      years (26.3% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001) and remained 2.22 times higher after adjusting 
      for comorbidities. DS patients over 30 years also exhibited a 22% increase in 
      mortality (PR 1.22, p < 0.001). Gene expression analysis of pre-pandemic 
      monocytes and T cells from DS individuals revealed upregulated pathways linked to 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, including interferon signaling and cytokine interactions. 
      This baseline immune dysregulation may contribute to severe COVID-19 outcomes in 
      DS patients. Identifying these altered pathways could inform targeted therapeutic 
      strategies to improve immune homeostasis and clinical outcomes. To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first study integrating nationwide clinical outcomes 
      with pre-pandemic immune transcriptomic data to mechanistically explain the 
      heightened COVID-19 severity in individuals with DS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To leverage passively collected retrospective smartphone location data 
      to accurately identify malaria transmission hotspots through the development of a 
      novel tool, the Sickness Positioning System. METHODS: We collected anonymized 
      location history data from over 200 malaria-infected individuals using Google 
      Takeout. Sickness Positioning System applies density-based clustering techniques 
      to this passively collected data to identify areas of elevated infection risk. 
      The identified hotspots were subsequently validated through field investigations. 
      RESULTS: Sickness Positioning System successfully pinpointed multiple areas of 
      increased malaria transmission risk. Field validation confirmed two previously 
      unrecognized mosquito breeding sites as active sources of transmission. When 
      compared to Brazil's federal surveillance system - which updates data annually - 
      Sickness Positioning System provided a more precise and timely spatial assessment 
      of malaria spread. CONCLUSION: Sickness Positioning System demonstrates a 
      cost-effective, objective, and timely method for identifying malaria transmission 
      hotspots. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance disease 
      surveillance and facilitate more targeted public health interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21 (T21), resulting from an extra copy 
      of chromosome 21, occurs in 1 in 700-1,000 live births. Neuroinflammation is 
      increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to DS neuropathology, although 
      its underlying drivers remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 
      available single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data from postmortem cortical 
      brains of individuals with DS and controls aged 36 years or younger, focusing 
      specifically on astrocyte-enriched clusters. This analysis revealed significant 
      alterations in complement system gene sets. To further investigate these 
      findings, we employed a human in vitro model using astrocytes differentiated from 
      urine-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from individuals 
      with DS (T21-iPSCs). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate both 
      gene expression and protein levels of secreted complement components in 
      T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes. RESULTS: snRNAseq re-analyzes identified an 
      upregulation of complement system components, including C1R, C1S, C2, C4A, C4B, 
      C5, C5AR1, C6, C8, CD59, CFI, and FCN2, and of glutamate transporters SLC1A3 
      (EAAT1/GLAST-1) and SLC1A2 (EAAT2/GLT-1) in DS astrocytes. Results from the in 
      vitro model revealed distinct phenotypic changes in T21-iPSC-derived astrocytes, 
      including enlarged cell and nuclear sizes, and enhanced glutamate uptake. 
      Elevated levels of C5aR1 and MASP1 transcripts, as well as increased C4 protein 
      secretion in culture supernatants, suggest dysregulation of the complement system 
      in DS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential contribution of 
      astrocyte-driven complement signaling to DS neuropathogenesis. While further 
      validation is needed, this work points to a candidate pathway that may serve as a 
      target for future therapeutic investigation to improve the quality of life for 
      individuals with DS.

LID - e70742
AB  - Hepatitis is a systemic disease marked by neuroimmune dysregulation beyond 
      hepatic inflammation. Using a systems biology approach, we conducted 
      transcriptomic meta-analyses across in vitro models, liver tissues, and PBMCs 
      from hepatitis virus-infected patients to identify neuroimmune signatures. We 
      found a robust neuroimmunome signature, with neuroimmune-related genes showing 
      consistent differential expression across datasets. Functional enrichment 
      revealed disruptions in neurotransmission (including synaptic, glutamatergic, 
      noradrenergic and neuregulin pathways) and immune signaling (such as cytokines, 
      interleukin-1 response, T cell receptor, and trans-synaptic signaling). Linear 
      discriminant analysis (LDA) demonstrated that neuroimmune genes can predict 
      disease severity. Several of these genes were also altered in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), implicating 
      them in oncogenic transformation. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed dysregulated 
      neuroimmune interactions in liver tissue, notably involving DBH-ADRA1A/B/D, 
      ADRA2A/B/C, ADRB1/2/3, IL33-IL1RL1, and NRG1-ERBB4. Critically, we observed an 
      inverse correlation between neuroimmune gene expression and inflammation markers 
      in advanced HCC, suggesting that neuroimmune suppression may facilitate immune 
      evasion. These findings highlight the neuroimmunome as a potential biomarker and 
      therapeutic target in hepatitis and its complications, reinforcing the role of 
      neuroimmune crosstalk in liver disease progression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifaceted psychiatric illness with 
      profound global consequences. To illuminate its molecular underpinnings, we 
      employed a genome-driven integrative systems neuroimmunology approach to analyze 
      transcriptomic profiles from 3114 individuals (1877 MDD patients and 1237 
      controls). This analysis uncovered coordinated neuroimmune transcriptomic shifts, 
      marked by altered expression of genes involved in innate immune regulation, 
      suppression of inflammatory responses, and pathways related to sensory 
      perception, visual system development, and synaptic signaling. These alterations 
      were consistently observed in both peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and brain 
      regions implicated in MDD. Among 31 genes jointly dysregulated in blood and 
      brain, four stood out as robust predictors of MDD in PBLs: NEGR1, PPP6C, SORCS3, 
      and PAX6. Of these, PAX6, a gene previously linked to MDD by GWAS, also exhibited 
      differential expression in the amygdala and was functionally enriched in pathways 
      governing immune modulation, vesicle trafficking, and neurodevelopmental 
      processes, such as neuronal fate determination. In contrast, NEGR1, PPP6C, and 
      SORCS3 showed no significant changes in brain expression, suggesting a 
      predominantly peripheral role. Importantly, these transcriptomic insights were 
      reinforced in a murine model of chronic stress, where immunophenotyping revealed 
      elevated PAX6 expression in peripheral myeloid cells. Together, these findings 
      reveal a shared neuroimmune signature across the brain and immune system in MDD, 
      highlighting PAX6 as a promising mechanistic link and potential biomarker for 
      this disorder.

      population studies, and data integration.

AB  - Vaccines have improved global health substantially, preventing millions of deaths 
      worldwide. However, striking variations in the immunogenicity and efficacy of 
      some vaccines persist across populations. Notably, suboptimal responses to some 
      vaccines, also known as vaccine hyporesponsiveness, have been observed in 
      low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income 
      countries or in rural areas within LMICs compared with urban areas within LMICs. 
      Environmental factors, host genetics, lifestyle, and nutrition contribute to 
      immunological variations influencing vaccine responses, highlighting the need to 
      identify key immune signatures that can be manipulated to overcome vaccine 
      hyporesponsiveness. The integration of diverse datasets, accelerated by 
      artificial intelligence, is essential to achieve this goal, which is currently 
      hampered by the under-representation of data from LMICs. The HypoVax Global 
      knowledge hub aims to address this gap by fostering international collaboration 
      and compiling globally representative immunological data from population studies 
      and vaccine trials. The hub offers a platform for high-dimensional data analyses, 
      promotes equitable partnerships, and strives to ensure that all contributions 
      lead to context-specific insights that can inform immunisation strategies to 
      ultimately overcome vaccine hyporesponsiveness.

TI  - Discovery of protease inhibitors from bacteria as novel adjuvants for oral 
      vaccine formulations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a need for mucosal vaccines that can fight pathogens at 
      the site of infection. At present, there are no approved adjuvants for mucosal 
      vaccines. Among different immunization routes, oral delivery is the natural 
      choice because of its ease of administration. However, oral administration has 
      two main drawbacks: proteolytic digestion and immune tolerance. METHODS: In this 
      study, a systematic in silico screening of putative protease inhibitors (PIs) 
      from bacteria to identify novel oral vaccine adjuvants was conducted. Selected 
      candidates were then evaluated for their ability to inhibit gastrointestinal 
      proteases and to stimulate murine dendritic cells. Finally, promising candidates 
      were incorporated as adjuvants into oral vaccine formulations containing model 
      (OVA) or real antigens, such as the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and tetanus 
      toxoid and tested in in vivo experiments. In addition, a proteomic analysis to 
      assess their effects on dendritic cells was performed. RESULTS: This approach led 
      to the selection of 11 PIs from human pathogenic bacteria, representing diverse 
      families of PIs. These proteins were then expressed in E. coli; five of them 
      demonstrated soluble expression and efficient purification. Three candidates 
      -Ecotin from Salmonella, APRin from Pseudomonas, and STA (staphostatin A) from 
      Staphylococcus aureus- exhibited both protease inhibition and TLR4-independent 
      dendritic-cell activation. In vivo studies demonstrated that Ecotin, APRin, and 
      STA enhanced immune responses when orally co-administered with OVA, promoting 
      T-cell proliferation and antibody production. Further evaluation with real 
      antigens, confirmed their adjuvant effect by inducing mucosal and systemic 
      immunity. Proteomic analysis of dendritic cells treated with these proteins 
      revealed significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, including interferon 
      and TNF-signaling, as well as metabolic pathways linked to immune activation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that three protease inhibitors from 
      bacteria: Ecotin, APRin, and STA function as novel oral mucosal adjuvants capable 
      of modulating immune responses and enhancing antigen immunogenicity.

      circadian gene regulation.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health challenge, with the current BCG 
      vaccine providing limited efficacy in adults, and available treatments being 
      lengthy and debilitating. To overcome these challenges, we have previously 
      developed a recombinant BCG strain expressing the detoxified E. coli Heat-Labile 
      Toxin (LTAK63), providing increased protection in mouse models and reduced lung 
      pathology. Here, using systems biology and RNA sequencing of lung tissues in a 
      murine model, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying rBCG-LTAK63's 
      increased protection. Immunization triggered early activation of cAMP-related 
      pathways, leading to hypoxia, autophagy, and circadian rhythm gene regulation. 
      These processes were associated with an enhanced innate immunity and promoted 
      long-lasting Th1/Th17 adaptive responses. Upon challenge, mice immunized with 
      rBCG-LTAK63 exhibited an earlier onset of interferon-gamma response, reduced 
      bacterial burden, and improved lung histopathology. Notably, circadian rhythm 
      regulation was directly linked to a controlled inflammatory response and reduced 
      migration of infection-susceptible cells, resulting in decreased immunopathology. 
      Our findings demonstrate that rBCG-LTAK63 orchestrates protection through the 
      integration of metabolic and temporal immune pathways. This work provides 
      mechanistic insights into how rational vaccine design can reprogram host immunity 
      to enhance protection and reduce pathology, supporting rBCG-LTAK63 as a promising 
      next-generation TB vaccine candidate.

AB  - Perineural invasion (PNI) is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
      (PDAC) associated with poor prognosis. Despite its clinical significance, the 
      specific cellular and molecular mechanisms driving PNI in PDAC remain poorly 
      defined. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data from approximately 60,000 
      single cells across 24 PDAC biopsy specimens to characterize the cellular 
      composition and signaling networks associated with PNI. We found that pancreatic 
      stellate cells (PSCs) expressing high levels of Periostin (POSTN), collagens, and 
      metalloproteinases are enriched in PNI-positive samples, suggesting an active 
      role in extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion. Spatial 
      transcriptomics revealed that these POSTN + PSCs are located adjacent to tumor 
      cells in invasive regions but are more distant in non-invasive samples. Invasive 
      tumors show a coordinated expression pattern involving ANXA1 in tumor cells, SPP1 
      and PLAU in PSCs, and their receptors in myeloid cells, supporting a signaling 
      axis that promotes perineural invasion. This spatial arrangement indicates that 
      POSTN + PSCs are not merely bystanders but active participants in driving tumor 
      infiltration and perineural dissemination. Together, these findings reveal 
      coordinated multicellular programs that underlie tumor invasion and spread in 
      PDAC, offering new insights into its aggressive biology.

TI  - A safe, T cell-inducing heterologous vaccine against elephant endotheliotropic 
      herpesvirus in a proof-of-concept study.
PG  - 8374

AB  - We report the results of the world's first trial of a vaccine against elephant 
      endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) in elephants. EEHV-induced haemorrhagic 
      disease is a major threat to juvenile Asian elephants. A vaccine preventing 
      severe disease and death would support conservation efforts for this endangered 
      species. We developed a heterologous, recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara 
      prime and adjuvanted protein boost vaccine, containing regulatory protein EE2 and 
      major capsid protein. Vaccine design targeted Th1 and cytotoxic T cell responses, 
      crucial for herpesvirus immunity. In a proof-of-concept trial, safety and 
      immunogenicity were tested in adult elephants. A modified interferon-γ release 
      (IFNG) point-of-care vaccine-specific whole blood assay was established to avoid 
      sample transport-related loss of immune readouts and determine T cell responses 
      by RT-qPCR first. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was utilised to investigate 
      transcriptomic changes post-vaccination. No adverse reactions were observed 
      following heterologous vaccination. IFNG responses to candidate antigens were 
      detected against the pre-existing latent immunity in adult elephants. 
      Over-representation analysis revealed induction of T cell-associated pathways. 
      Thus, we show that the vaccine has a favourable safety profile and stimulates 
      EEHV-specific T cell-biased immune responses, warranting further evaluation.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and systems biology analysis in stem cell research and 
      therapeutics development.
LID - 10.1093/stcltm/szaf037 [doi]
LID - szaf037
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem cell research has rapidly advanced during the past decades, but 
      the translation into approved clinical products is still lagging behind. Multiple 
      barriers to effective clinical translation exist. We hypothesize that an 
      ineffective use of the existing wealth of data from both product development and 
      clinical trials is a crucial barrier that hampers effective clinical 
      implementation of stem cell therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we summarize 
      the contribution of systems biology (SysBio) and artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      stem cell research and therapy development, to better understand and overcome 
      these barriers to effective clinical translation. Advancements in cell product 
      profiling technology, clinical trial design, and adjunct clinical monitoring, 
      offer new opportunities for a more integrated understanding of both, product and 
      patient performance. Synergy of SysBioAI analysis is boosting a more rapid, 
      integrated, and informative analysis of large‑scale multi‑omics data sets of 
      patient and clinical trial outcomes, thus enabling the "Iterative Circle of 
      Refined Clinical Translation". This SysBioAI‑supported concept can assist more 
      effective development and clinical use of stem cell therapeutics through 
      iterative adaptation cycles. This includes product‑ and patient‑centered clinical 
      safety and efficacy/potency evaluation through paired identification of suitable 
      biomarkers of clinical response. CONCLUSION: Integrated SysBioAI-use is a 
      powerful tool to optimize the design and outcomes of clinical trials by 
      identifying patient-specific responses, contributing to enhanced treatment safety 
      and efficacy, and to spur new patient-centric and adaptable next-generation 
      deep-medicine approaches.

AB  - Proteostasis, maintained by a network of molecular chaperones, plays a central 
      role in cell biology, and has emerged as a critical mechanism underlying 
      pluripotency and development. The stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is a 
      co-chaperone essential for proteostasis. STIP1 knockout causes embryonic 
      lethality in mice, but its precise function during embryogenesis remains poorly 
      understood. Here, we investigate the role of STIP1 in early development using in 
      silico and cell-based approaches. Single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals that 
      Stip1 is co-expressed with pluripotency genes in mouse embryos, suggesting a role 
      in stem cell maintenance. To test this, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells 
      (mESCs) from genetically modified mice with altered Stip1/STIP1 expression. STIP1 
      depletion in mESCs decreases the expression of pluripotency markers, reduces 
      proliferation, and induces apoptosis and genomic instability, whereas its 
      overexpression enhances pluripotency markers expression, promotes proliferation, 
      and confers protection against cellular stress. Moreover, proteins involved in 
      cell cycle progression and DNA damage response are differentially regulated in 
      mESCs, depending on STIP1 levels. Our findings highlight STIP1 as a pivotal 
      regulator of the pluripotent phenotype, early embryogenesis, and cellular 
      resilience, advancing our understanding of proteostasis in stem cell biology and 
      organismal development, with potential implications for disease modeling and 
      regenerative medicine.

AB  - Refined control of intrinsic and extrinsic signals is critical for specific 
      neuronal differentiation. Here, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (hiPSCs) from three different healthy donors into neural stem cells (NSCs) 
      and floor plate progenitors (FPPs; progenitors of dopaminergic neurons) and 
      further performed intracellular and extracellular vesicles' (EVs) miRNA 
      profiling. While NSC and FPP cells differed significantly in levels of only 8 
      intracellular miRNAs, their differences were more evident in the EV miRNAs with 
      27 differentially expressed miRNAs. Target validation of intracellular miRNAs 
      revealed that FPPs expressed more EXOC5 mRNA than NSCs, which is implicated in 
      the function of primary cilia, an essential signaling organelle in FPPs. 
      Moreover, we found a group of 5 miRNAs consistently enriched in EVs from these 
      three cell types. This study presents a foundation for the field of miRNA 
      regulation in neural development and provides new insights for disease modeling 
      and regenerative medicine.

TI  - Modulation of neuroimmune cytokine networks by antidepressants: implications in 
      mood regulation.
PG  - 314
LID - 10.1038/s41398-025-03532-y [doi]

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is increasingly recognized as a neuroinflammatory 
      condition characterized by dysregulated cytokine networks. This comprehensive 
      review examines the immunomodulatory effects of antidepressant medications, 
      revealing their significant impact on Th1/Th2 cytokine balance beyond their 
      classical neurotransmitter actions. Clinical data show that diverse 
      antidepressant classes consistently demonstrate immunomodulatory properties that 
      extend beyond their classical neurotransmitter effects. These medications reduce 
      pro-inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory 
      cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), effects particularly relevant for treatment-resistant 
      cases with elevated baseline inflammation. The therapeutic potential of these 
      immunoregulatory effects is supported by emerging interventions, including 
      low-dose IL-2 immunotherapy, vagus nerve stimulation, and microbiota-targeted 
      therapies, which show promise for specific depression subtypes. Importantly, 
      these approaches appear most effective when guided by inflammatory biomarkers, 
      suggesting a path toward personalized treatment strategies. By integrating 
      findings from clinical studies and translational research, this work establishes 
      immune modulation as a fundamental component of antidepressant action. The review 
      provides a framework for developing next-generation treatments that target 
      neuroimmune pathways in MDD, with particular emphasis on practical applications 
      for treatment-resistant cases. These insights bridge the gap between 
      neuropharmacology and clinical psychiatry, offering new therapeutic possibilities 
      for patients with inflammation-associated depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reduced life expectancy observed in individuals with 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. 
      Emerging evidence suggests that astrocytic dysfunction and immune-inflammatory 
      processes contribute to SCZ pathophysiology. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX), an 
      established immunomodulatory drug used for non-neurological conditions, 
      demonstrated antipsychotic potential in early SCZ. However, the underlying 
      mechanisms remain unknown. AIMS: This study aimed to identify molecular targets 
      of MTX within SCZ-relevant pathways, focusing on astrocytic and neuroimmune 
      networks using in silico bioinformatics analysis and a rodent model for SCZ. 
      METHODS: In silico analysis: A bioinformatics-based approach was employed, 
      integrating cognitive computing-generated knowledge graphs, modular co-expression 
      analysis, and gene-drug interaction databases with a machine learning-based 
      text-mining tool. Rodent model: The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801-induced mouse 
      model for SCZ was used to assess MTX's therapeutic potential, compared to 
      clozapine. Behavioural outcomes (sociability and cognition) and astrocytic 
      reactivity (GFAP expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: In silico: MTX preferentially targeted hub genes within 
      astrocyte and NFκB modules. In astrocytes, MTX modulated NT5E, a key regulator of 
      adenosine metabolism. In the NFκB module, MTX interacted with IL-6 and STAT3, 
      both involved in immune regulation. Rodent model: MK-801 administration impaired 
      sociability and cognition, accompanied by increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in 
      the prelimbic mPFC, both of which were prevented by MTX. The neuroimmunomodulator 
      effect of MTX was comparable to clozapine in both the in silico and rodent model. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the potential 
      antipsychotic-like effects of low-dose MTX in SCZ, involving astrocytic 
      modulation and immune regulation. Further experimental medicine studies in 
      clinical populations stratified by astrocytic and neuroinflammatory biomarkers 
      are warranted to validate these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPredicting individual vaccine responses is a substantial public health 
      challenge. We developed Immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework for 
      systems vaccinologists to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across 
      diverse vaccination settings, beyond traditional assessments.METHODSUsing a 
      comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) dataset from 244 Gambian 
      children, Immunaut integrated prevaccination and postvaccination humoral, 
      mucosal, cellular, and transcriptomic data. Through advanced modeling, our 
      framework provided a holistic, systems-level view of LAIV-induced 
      immunity.RESULTSThe analysis identified 3 distinct immunophenotypic profiles 
      driven by baseline immunity: (a) CD8+ T cell responders with strong preexisting 
      immunity boosting memory T cell responses; (b) mucosal responders with prior 
      influenza A virus immunity developing robust mucosal IgA and subsequent influenza 
      B virus seroconversion; and (c) systemic, broad influenza A virus responders 
      starting from immune naivety who mounted broad systemic antibody responses. 
      Pathway analysis revealed how preexisting immune landscapes and baseline 
      features, such as mucosal preparedness and cellular support, quantitatively 
      dictate vaccine outcomes.CONCLUSIONOur findings emphasize the power of 
      integrative, predictive frameworks for advancing precision vaccinology. The 
      Immunaut framework is a valuable resource for deciphering vaccine response 
      heterogeneity and can be applied to optimize immunization strategies across 
      diverse populations and vaccine platforms.FUNDINGWellcome Trust (110058/Z/15/Z);

AB  - During persistent antigen stimulation, CD8(+) T cell responses are maintained by 
      progenitor exhausted CD8(+) T (Tpex) cells. Tpex cells respond to blockade of the 
      inhibitory receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and regulation of their 
      differentiation is critical for immunotherapies. Tpex cells highly express 
      inducible costimulator (ICOS), but how ICOS modulates PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells is 
      not clear. During chronic infection, intrinsic ICOS deficiency increased number 
      and quality of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. Loss of ICOS potentiated activity 
      of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and memory-like features of 
      Tpex cells. ICOS-deficient Tpex cells were poised to generate effecor-like cells 
      with improved survival and cytokine production. ICOS-ligand (ICOSL) blockade 
      expanded effector-like PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells, reduced viral load, and improved 
      response to PD-1 blockade. Similarly, in a mouse model of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, ICOS inhibition enhanced tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and 
      tumor control by PD-1 blockade. Overall, we show that sustained ICOS 
      costimulation limits CD8(+) T cell responses during chronic antigen exposure.

TI  - In vitro morphological profiling of T cells predicts clinical response to 
      natalizumab therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Despite the efficacy of natalizumab, which targets the integrin VLA-4, in 
      treating multiple sclerosis (MS), approximately 35% patients with MS present 
      evidence of disease activity two years after treatment initiation. Individual 
      heterogeneity of leukocyte response to VLA-4 on natalizumab-mediated blockade may 
      underlie disparities in treatment efficacy. Here we use a high-content cell 
      imaging (HCI) pipeline to profile the in vitro effects of natalizumab on 
      VLA-4-stimulated PBMCs from MS patients prior to natalizumab treatment. 
      Unsupervised clustering of image data partially discriminates non-responder MS 
      patients based on morphology, F-actin organization and signaling-related features 
      in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, through a random forest approach, treatment 
      response can be predicted with a performance of 92% for a discovery cohort and 
      88% for a validation cohort. Unfavorable treatment response is associated with a 
      distinct actin remodeling response of natalizumab-exposed CD8(+) T cells and a 
      residual ability of these cells to spread on VCAM-1. Our study thus unveils that 
      CD8(+) T cells from individual MS patients display heterogeneous susceptibility 
      to natalizumab in vitro and highlights the potential of HCI-based pretreatment 
      monitoring to assist individualized treatment prescription.

AB  - Dengue, a widespread mosquito-borne disease, annually afflicts millions globally, 
      posing substantial mortality risks. Preceding disease defervescence, a marked and 
      transient surge in antibody-secreting cell (ASC) frequency correlates with 
      disease severity, paralleled by heightened tryptophan degradation. Investigating 
      details of this process through single-cell transcriptomics from public 
      repositories, our data pinpoint CD14+ monocytes as principal IDO1 and IDO2 
      expressors, implicating them, rather than B cells, in initiating tryptophan 
      metabolism. Interestingly, naive B cells exhibit altered gene expression 
      indicative of early impact by tryptophan deficiency before defervescence with a 
      potential impact on the B cell fate. Dengue-induced ASCs upregulated GCN2, PERK, 
      eIF2a, ATF4 genes as well as BIM and CASP-3. However, the high expression of 
      anti-apoptotic genes (FKBP8 [a CHOP-regulated gene], BCL-XL, BCL-2, MCL-1) allows 
      enhanced ASC survival. Proliferation and differentiation-related genes (eIF4EBP1, 
      RRM2, and HIF1a) were also upregulated in ASCs. These findings untangle how 
      Dengue modulates the host metabolism and B-cell responses, although further 
      research is needed to fully understand their implications on disease progression.

AB  - The COVID-19 vaccinations have played a significant role in controlling the 
      pandemic. To elucidate their impact on the immune system, a COVID-19 vaccination 
      atlas was developed using an integrative systems vaccinology approach. The atlas 
      includes 562 samples from 245 participants, including both healthy individuals 
      and those infected with or without prior vaccination, and covers the 
      administration of five vaccines in different regimens. Key findings include the 
      identification of distinct immune markers that differentiate between vaccine 
      types and infection statuses. We observed that mRNA vaccines induced transient 
      but strong immune responses after booster doses, whereas viral vector vaccines 
      showed sustained immune activation with infection, partially resembling the 
      immune profile exhibited during infection. Heterologous vaccination regimens 
      demonstrated enhanced immune diversification compared to homologous regimens. 
      Finally, we described the immunological landscape of COVID-19 vaccines and 
      vaccines against other pathogens, at the gene-level and in cell population 
      dynamics.

TI  - Transcriptomic and Immunopathological Profiles of Inflammasomes in Different 
      Clinical Forms of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13050980 [doi]
LID - 980
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) 
      amazonensis and L. (Viannia) braziliensis, presents a wide spectrum of clinical 
      and immunopathological manifestations, ranging from localized cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (LCL) to severe forms like anergic diffuse cutaneous (ADCL) and 
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Despite evidence of the immune response's 
      complexity, the role of inflammasomes in disease severity and parasite 
      persistence remains unclear. We investigated the transcriptomic and 
      immunopathological profiles of inflammasome components in patient lesions across 
      the clinical spectrum. Genes such as NLRP3, AIM2, NLRP12, NLRC4, CASP1, CASP5, 
      GSDMD, and IL1B and all evaluated proteins, showed higher expression in ACL 
      compared to healthy controls. Distinct inflammasome activation patterns were 
      observed: MCL, the hyperreactive form, showed elevated NLRP3, AIM2, and IL-1β, 
      indicating an intensified inflammatory environment. ADCL, the hyporeactive form, 
      displayed increased NLRP12 and NLRC4 expression with reduced GSDMD. Localized 
      forms showed transitional profiles, highlighting ACL's multifactorial 
      pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms 
      in ACL, identifying potential therapeutic targets to modulate inflammation and 
      improve management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uveitis accounts for up to 25% of global legal blindness and 
      involves intraocular inflammation, classifed as infectious or non-infectious. Its 
      complex pathophysiology includes dysregulated cytokines, particularly interferons 
      (IFNs). However, the global signature of type I, II, and III interferon-regulated 
      genes (Interferome) remains largely uncharacterized in uveitis. METHODS: In this 
      study, we conducted an integrative systems biology analysis of blood 
      transcriptome data from 169 non-infectious uveitis patients (56 isolated uveitis, 
      113 systemic disease-associated uveitis) and 82 healthy controls. RESULTS: 
      Modular co-expression analysis identified distinct cytokine signaling networks, 
      emphasizing interleukin and interferon pathways. A meta-analysis revealed 110 
      differentially expressed genes (metaDEGs) in isolated uveitis and 91 in systemic 
      disease-associated uveitis, predominantly linked to immune responses. The 
      Interferome database confirmed a predominance of type I and II IFN signatures in 
      both groups. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted inflammatory responses, 
      including cytokine production (IL-8, IL1-β, IFN-γ, β, and α) and toll-like 
      receptor signaling (TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, CD180). Principal component analysis 
      emphasized the IFN signature's discriminative power, particularly in systemic 
      disease-associated uveitis. Machine learning identified IFN-associated genes as 
      robust predictors, while linear discriminant analysis pinpointed CCR2, CD180, 
      GAPT, and PTGS2 as key risk factors in isolated uveitis and CA1, SIAH2, and PGS 
      in systemic disease-associated uveitis. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight 
      IFN-driven imune dysregulation and potential molecular targets for precision 
      therapies in uveitis.

AB  - Gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary tumors of the central nervous 
      system. Dysregulated transcription factors (TFs) and genes have been implicated 
      in glioma progression, yet these tumors' overall structure of gene regulatory 
      networks (GRNs) remains undefined. We analyzed transcriptional data from 989 
      primary gliomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome 
      Atlas (CGGA) to address this. GRNs were reconstructed using the RTN package which 
      identifies regulons-sets of genes regulated by a common TF based on co-expression 
      and mutual information. Regulon activity was evaluated through Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis. Elastic net regularization and Cox regression identified 31 
      and 32 prognostic genes in the TCGA and CGGA datasets, respectively, with 11 
      genes overlapping, many of which are associated with neural development and 
      synaptic processes. GAS2L3, HOXD13, and OTP demonstrated the strongest 
      correlations with survival outcomes among these. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 
      201,986 cells revealed distinct expression patterns for these genes in glioma 
      subpopulations, particularly oligoprogenitor cells. This study uncovers key GRNs 
      and prognostic genes in gliomas, offering new insights into tumor biology and 
      potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Squalene-based emulsion (SE) adjuvants like MF59 and AS03 are used in protein 
      subunit vaccines against influenza virus (e.g., Fluad, Pandemrix, Arepanrix) and 
      SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Covifenz, SKYCovione). We demonstrate the critical role of uric 
      acid (UA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), in triggering 
      immunogenicity by SE adjuvants. In mice, SE adjuvants elevated DAMP levels in 
      draining lymph nodes. Strikingly, inhibition of UA synthesis reduced 
      vaccine-induced innate immunity, subsequently impairing optimal antibody and T 
      cell responses. In vivo treatment with UA crystals elicited partial adjuvant 
      effects. In vitro stimulation with UA crystals augmented the activation of 
      dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and altered multiple pathways in these cells, 
      including inflammation and antigen presentation in DCs and cell proliferation in 
      B cells. In an influenza vaccine model, UA contributed to protection against 
      influenza viral infection. These results demonstrate the importance of DAMPs, 
      specifically the versatile role of UA in the immunogenicity of SE adjuvants, by 
      regulating DCs and B cells.

TI  - Molecular Insights into Cell-Mediated Immunity in Atypical Non-Ulcerated 
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13020413 [doi]
LID - 413
AB  - Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infections range from asymptomatic (AS) 
      to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). One of the manifestations is an atypical 
      non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of 
      Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of 
      cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from 
      Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation 
      of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in 
      NUCL involved in CD8(+) T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species 
      generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement 
      receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL 
      by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T 
      lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and 
      down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated 
      DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, 
      down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome 
      findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin 
      lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS 
      and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the 
      benign nature of the NUCL.

TI  - Transcriptomic insights into early mechanisms underlying post-chikungunya chronic 
      inflammatory joint disease.
PG  - 6745

LID - 6745
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection often results in a chronic joint condition 
      known as Post-Chikungunya Chronic Inflammatory Joint Disease (pCHIKV-CIJD). This 
      condition disrupts individuals' daily lives and contributes to increased 
      healthcare expenditure. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying pCHIKV-CIJD development by analyzing RNA transcripts, including small 
      RNAs, of whole blood from CHIKV-infected patients. By comparing patients who 
      evolved to pCHIKV-CIJD with those who did not, we identified molecular signatures 
      associated with chronification in acute and post-acute disease phases. These 
      molecules were primarily associated with an altered immune response regulation. 
      Notably, LIFR, an immune receptor that enhanced IL-6 transcription, was 
      down-regulated in the acute phase of pCHIKV-CIJD patients, while its inhibitor, 
      hsa-miR-98-5p, was up-regulated in these individuals. Other downregulated genes 
      include members of immune mechanisms whose impairment can lead to a reduction in 
      the first line of antiviral response, thereby promoting virus persistence for a 
      longer period in these patients. Additionally, pCHIKV-CIJD patients exhibited 
      reduced transcript levels of MMP8, LFT, and DDIT4, genes already implicated in 
      the pathological process of other types of inflammatory arthritis and seemingly 
      relevant for pCHIKV-CIJD development. Overall, our findings provide insights into 
      the early molecular mechanisms involved in the chronification and highlight 
      potential targets for further investigation.

AB  - Brain metastasis is the most common type of brain cancer, associated with 
      significant neurological dysfunction and a poor prognosis. We investigated the 
      transcriptome of 128,421 single-cells of 36 brain metastases, originating from a 
      variety of primary tumors, including melanoma, breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, 
      and renal cancers. Our aim was to identify common molecular factors across these 
      tumors, shedding light on key interactions that facilitate tumor establishment in 
      the brain. We specifically focused on the dynamics of the blood-tumor barrier and 
      its effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Our analysis decoded 
      complex cell-cell communications, emphasizing the crucial role of astrocytes in 
      the tumor microenvironment (TME). This provided insights into how these 
      interactions impact the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier and contribute to 
      the development of brain metastases. We identified the VEGFA, SEMA3, and SPP1 
      pathways as key regulators in brain metastasis, affecting vascular permeability 
      and cellular dynamics. Spatial transcriptome analysis confirmed our findings and 
      linked these pathways to TME enrichment. The pronounced expression of VEGFA by 
      cancer cells suggests a significant activation of angiogenic pathways, 
      influencing vascular responses and the intricate architecture of brain tissue. 
      The interplay of these signaling pathways underlines the complexity of molecular 
      interactions that define the microenvironment of brain metastases.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a wide spectrum of symptoms, the 
      causes of which remain poorly understood. This study explored the associations 
      between autoantibodies (AABs), particularly those targeting G protein-coupled 
      receptors (GPCRs) and renin‒angiotensin system (RAS) molecules, and the clinical 
      manifestations of COVID-19. Using a cross-sectional analysis of 244 individuals, 
      we applied multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, and 
      multinomial regression to examine the relationships between AAB levels and key 
      symptoms. Significant correlations were identified between specific AABs and 
      symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Notably, anti-AGTR1 
      antibodies, which contribute to endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) degradation, a 
      process reversed by losartan, have emerged as strong predictors of core symptoms. 
      AAB levels increased with symptom accumulation, peaking in patients exhibiting 
      all four key symptoms. These findings highlight the role of AABs, particularly 
      anti-AGTR1 antibodies, in determining symptom severity and suggest their 
      involvement in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including vascular complications.

TI  - System vaccinology analysis of predictors and mechanisms of antibody response 
      durability to multiple vaccines in humans.

AB  - We performed a systems vaccinology analysis to investigate immune responses in 
      humans to an H5N1 influenza vaccine, with and without the AS03 adjuvant, to 
      identify factors influencing antibody response magnitude and durability. Our 
      findings revealed a platelet and adhesion-related blood transcriptional signature 
      on day 7 that predicted the longevity of the antibody response, suggesting a 
      potential role for platelets in modulating antibody response durability. As 
      platelets originate from megakaryocytes, we explored the effect of thrombopoietin 
      (TPO)-mediated megakaryocyte activation on antibody response longevity. We found 
      that TPO administration enhanced the durability of vaccine-induced antibody 
      responses. TPO-activated megakaryocytes also promoted survival of human 
      bone-marrow plasma cells through integrin β1/β2-mediated cell-cell interactions, 
      along with survival factors APRIL and the MIF-CD74 axis. Using machine learning, 
      we developed a classifier based on this platelet-associated signature, which 
      predicted antibody response longevity across six vaccines from seven independent 
      trials, highlighting a conserved mechanism for vaccine durability.
